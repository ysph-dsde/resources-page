Sharing information among our peers is critical for responding to a public health crisis and understanding the mechanisms driving emerging diseases. We’ll release our virus genetic data and any useful protocols or analysis tools as soon as they are generated. Please note that because these are usually early releases (pre-publication), they may contain mistakes. We’ll make protocols, analysis tools, and data available as they are developed.       image: Images/grubaugh.png       topic: "Basic Research, Analytical Tools, Consulting/Services"       site: https://grubaughlab.com/open-science/       group: https://grubaughlab.com/     - title: Git Going       description: |         Workshop on using git and GitHub.       image: Images/AdobeStock_215933176 cropped.jpeg       topic: "Educational Materials"       site: https://weinbergerlab.gitlab.io/git-going/       group: https://medicine.yale.edu/lab/weinberger/     - title: Analysis of time series data       description: |         Guest lecture for quantitative methods in infectious disease class.       image: Images/AdobeStock_408552325.jpeg       topic: "Educational Materials"       github: https://github.com/weinbergerlab/quant_meth_id       group: https://medicine.yale.edu/lab/weinberger/     - title: Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) in R       description: |          Summer Course on Modeling in Public Health Day 2       image: Images/AdobeStock_323829966 cropped.jpeg       topic: "Educational Materials"       site: https://pitzerlab.github.io/IntroODESession/       group: https://medicine.yale.edu/lab/pitzer/-  category: "Yale School of Medicine"   tiles:     - title: Yale Biomedical Informatics & Computing (YBIC)       description: |         Yale Biomedical Informatics & Computing (YBIC) is a resource hub for researchers across Yale School of Medicine and Yale New Haven Health System.
