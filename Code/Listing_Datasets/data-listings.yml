# Filter/search behavior with the ejs file:
#   - Filter by three categories: 1. region and/or affiliation, 2. dataset 
#     content type, and 3. accessibility (i.e. restricted-use, license)
#   - Sort tiles by "title" and "date-updated". The user can
#     control how these two characteristics are sorted.
#   - Default sorting of the tiles is by "ranking" (ascending) then "title"
#     (A-Z)
# 
# 
# When adding new tiles:
#   - Under "items" each entry requires association with all three categories
#     and metadata that gets added under "tiles" |-> "- title: ** ".
#   - Group tiles with the SAME three categories together under the same "tiles".
#     This causes all tiles listed under that subsection to get filtered together
#     when the user selectes any or all three categories.
#   - Mandatory "tiles" |-> "- title: ** " fields: "title", "description", 
#     "date-added", "date-updated", "ranking," "image", "topic" to list the 
#     second category.
#   - Opional "tiles" |-> "- title: ** " fields: "site" for the main webpage for 
#     the source, "group" for the lab or group webpage who provides the source,
#     "github" for the codebase repository, "article" if there primary articles
#     presenting the resource by the creators, and "info" that links to an
#     internal page with additional details about the resource.
# 
# When editing existing tiles:
#   - Ensure that the new links work as expected.
#   - Change the "date-updated" entry for the tile you edited.
#   - Change the "last updated" sections at the top of the page.

          The Worldwide Index of Serotype Specific Pneumococcal Antibody Responses (WISSPAR) is a centralized platform housing data on immunogenicity from clinical trials of pneumococcal vaccines. The data on WISSPAR are primarily curated from outcomes tables from clinicaltrials.gov and are made available in a searchable format that can be readily used for downstream analyses. Fields included in the database include product, manufacturers, dosing schedule, age group, and geographic region. You can use the embedded tools to generate customizable visualizations, export data for further analyses, or just browse through clinical trial results.

          In our opinion, good science isn’t done in a vacuum. Sharing information among our peers is critical for responding to a public health crisis and understanding the mechanisms driving emerging diseases. We’ll release our virus genetic data and any useful protocols or analysis tools as soon as they are generated. Please note that because these are usually early releases (pre-publication), they may contain mistakes. We’ll make protocols, analysis tools, and data available as they are developed.

        description: |
         The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) collects data about the health of adults and children in the United States. This data has driven changes in medical treatment practices and public policy supporting good health . Since its inception in 1959, NHANES has completed eight distinct iterations of the survey, with the latest being conducted as an ongoing surveillance program. These efforts have led to the creation of four special focus programs or ancillary studies.
         </br>
         </br>
         Researchers can access both publicly available and restricted data produced by NHANES from all survey installments. Moreover, researchers have the opportunity to request biospecimens collected during some surveys, allowing for the generation of additional data points that enhance the research community's resources.

          The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is the nation's oldest continuously running health survey, established in 1957 to collect comprehensive health data from the U.S. civilian population. Conducted annually by the National Center for Health Statistics, NHIS provides nationally representative data on health trends, illness, disability, and healthcare utilization through face-to-face household interviews. The survey adapts over time to address emerging health topics and offers linked datasets to researchers through the Research Data Center.

          The Rapid Surveys System (RSS) is a time-sensitive data collection platform launched by the National Center for Health Statistics in 2022 to quickly gather actionable health data on emerging concerns. RSS leverages commercially available probability-based online panels, recruiting approximately 4,000 adults per round through AmeriSpeak and KnowledgePanel using address-based sampling methods. While prioritizing speed and flexibility over traditional survey precision, RSS provides nationally representative estimates to support real-time evidence-based public health decision making.

The system gathers national data on births, deaths, fetal deaths, marriages, and divorces from 57 U.S. registration areas, then standardizes these vital statistics to support public health research and policy-making. NVSS also conducts specialized surveys and data linkage projects to address specific health concerns.

          Since the 1980s, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Data Linkage program has combined NCHS survey data with administrative sources from Medicare, Medicaid, National Death Index, and Social Security records, supporting over 1,000 peer-reviewed publications. The program maximizes resource efficiency by using state-of-the-art data science matching techniques to link existing data, avoiding costly re-collection efforts. While most program resources require restrictive-access permissions to ensure participant privacy, the program takes every opportunity to make publicly available versions, including through innovative synthetic data generation.
