Here are a few of our ongoing ‘community’ Nextstrain projects. Note that most of these analyses are preliminary, so interpret with caution. We love to collaborate – contact us if you’d like to join one of these exciting projects!       image: Images/nextstrain.png       topic: "Basic Research Assays"       site: https://grubaughlab.com/       group: https://medicine.yale.edu/lab/weinberger/     - title: The Health Attribution Library       description: |         We compile studies that conduct end-to-end attribution studies on the human health impacts of human-caused climate change.

The data on WISSPAR are primarily curated from outcomes tables from clinicaltrials.gov and are made available in a searchable format that can be readily used for downstream analyses.         </br>         </br>         Fields included in the database include product, manufacturers, dosing schedule, age group, and geographic region. You can use the embedded tools to generate customizable visualizations, export data for further analyses, or just browse through clinical trial results.       image: Images/wisspar.png       topic: "Clinical Study/Surveys"       site: https://wisspar.com/       group: https://medicine.yale.edu/lab/weinberger/-  category: "Government Agency or Program"   tiles:     - title: National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)       description: |         The National Center for Health Statistics is the nation's source for official health statistics. We collect, analyze, and share data and statistics to guide programs and policies that improve the health of people across the United States.

Including: Family Growth Survey, Health Care Surveys, Rapid Surveys, Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, Health Interview Survey, Vital Statistics, and a special compilation of linked surveys with administrative data.

NHIS focuses on the health of U.S. children and adults.         </br>         </br>         CDC's National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) conducts NHIS. It is the nation's largest and oldest national health survey. NHIS began collecting data in 1957.         </br>         </br>         Each year, NHIS collects data from about 27,000 adults through confidential, face-to-face interviews throughout the year. Many of these adults also provide health information about children in their households.         </br>         </br>         NHIS collects data from civilians who don't live in institutions. Civilians are people not serving on active duty in the military. Institutionalized people live in places like correctional facilities, skilled-nursing homes, and mental (psychiatric) hospitals.       image: Images/nhis.png       topic: "Clinical Study/Surveys"       site: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/index.html     - title: NCHS's The National Health Care Surveys (NHCS)       description: |         The National Health Care Surveys are a family of surveys that provide information about—         <ul>             <li>Organizations and providers that deliver health care</li>             <li>The healthcare services they provide</li>             <li>The patients they serve across diverse healthcare settings</li>         </ul>         <p style="margin-bottom: -10px">Researchers, policymakers, and health professionals can use data from our surveys to understand providers, patients, and management and delivery of patient care in the United States.</p>       image: Images/nhcs.png       topic: "Clinical Study/Surveys"       site: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/healthcare-surveys/about/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fnchs%2Fupdates%2Fnational-health-care-surveys.html
