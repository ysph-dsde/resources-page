       description: |
         Nextstrain is an open-source project to harness the scientific and public health potential of pathogen genome data. Here are a few of our ongoing ‘community’ Nextstrain projects. Note that most of these analyses are preliminary, so interpret with caution. We love to collaborate – contact us if you’d like to join one of these exciting projects!

     - title: The Health Attribution Library
       description: |
         We compile studies that conduct end-to-end attribution studies on the human health impacts of human-caused climate change. The Health Attribution Library is a living resource, meant to provide evidence in support of scientific research, journalism, public interest, litigation, and political negotiations.

     - title: Worldwide Index of Serotype Specific Pneumococcal Antibody Responses (WISSPAR)
       description: |
         The Worldwide Index of Serotype Specific Pneumococcal Antibody Responses (WISSPAR) is a centralized platform housing data on immunogenicity from clinical trials of pneumococcal vaccines. The data on WISSPAR are primarily curated from outcomes tables from clinicaltrials.gov and are made available in a searchable format that can be readily used for downstream analyses.

         Fields included in the database include product, manufacturers, dosing schedule, age group, and geographic region. You can use the embedded tools to generate customizable visualizations, export data for further analyses, or just browse through clinical trial results.
