         The National Center for Health Statistics is the nation's source for official health statistics. We collect, analyze, and share data and statistics to guide programs and policies that improve the health of people across the United States.

         The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) monitors the health of people across the country—the U.S. population—by collecting and analyzing data on a broad range of health topics. NHIS focuses on the health of U.S. children and adults.

         CDC's National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) conducts NHIS. It is the nation's largest and oldest national health survey. NHIS began collecting data in 1957.
         </br>
         </br>
         Each year, NHIS collects data from about 27,000 adults through confidential, face-to-face interviews throughout the year. Many of these adults also provide health information about children in their households.

         </br>
         NHIS collects data from civilians who don't live in institutions. Civilians are people not serving on active duty in the military. Institutionalized people live in places like correctional facilities, skilled-nursing homes, and mental (psychiatric) hospitals.
