# Filter/search behavior with the ejs file:
#   - Filter by two categories: 1. region and/or affiliation and 2. types of
#     services offered
#   - Sort tiles by "title" and "date-updated". The user can
#     control how these two characteristics are sorted.
#   - Default sorting of the tiles is by "ranking" (ascending) then "title"
#     (A-Z)
# 
# 
# When adding new tiles:
#   - Under "items" each entry requires association with both categories
#     and metadata that gets added under "tiles" |-> "- title: ** ".
#   - Group tiles with the SAME two categories together under the same "tiles".
#     This causes all tiles listed under that subsection to get filtered together
#     when the user selectes any or both categories.
#   - Mandatory "tiles" |-> "- title: ** " fields: "title", "description", 
#     "date-added", "date-updated", "image", "topic" to list the second category.
#   - Opional "tiles" |-> "- title: ** " fields: "site" for the main webpage for 
#     the source, "group" for the lab or group webpage who provides the source,
#     "github" for the codebase repository, "article" if there primary articles
#     presenting the resource by the creators, and "info" that links to an
#     internal page with additional details about the resource.
# 
# When editing existing tiles:
#   - Ensure that the new links work as expected.
#   - Change the "date-updated" entry for the tile you edited.
#   - Change the "last updated" sections at the top of the page.

          In our opinion, good science isn’t done in a vacuum. Sharing information among our peers is critical for responding to a public health crisis and understanding the mechanisms driving emerging diseases. We’ll release our virus genetic data and any useful protocols or analysis tools as soon as they are generated. Please note that because these are usually early releases (pre-publication), they may contain mistakes. We’ll make protocols, analysis tools, and data available as they are developed.

          Combining polymer chemistry with quantitative proteomics, we have developed a quantitative guide for spatially-resolved extraction for more than 2100 MPs into native-nanodiscs. Searching for your protein(s) of interest will yield the preferred condition for optimal native extraction for that protein of interest serving as a starting point for structural and biochemical studies.

        description: |
          The Yale Magnetic Resonance Research Center (MRRC) was founded in 1986 as a result of the recognition that NMR applications, as pioneered by Yale scientists, have enormous potential in biomedical research. The MRRC is now an interdepartmental and interdisciplinary research laboratory that provides state-of-the-art MR equipment, infrastructure, and expertise for the development and application of MRI and MRS methodology in biomedical research. 
          </br>
          </br>
          Research is focused on the study of intact biological systems by developing methods for obtaining structural, functional, physiological and biochemical information by MRI, MRS and other techniques. Applications include fMRI for neurosurgery and neuroscience; brain, muscle, and liver energy metabolism; diabetes; adult and juvenile epilepsy; and psychiatric disorders.
