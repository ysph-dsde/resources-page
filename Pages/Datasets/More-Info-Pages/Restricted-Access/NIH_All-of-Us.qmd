## Overview

Overseen and supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the All of Us (AoU) initiative is a precision medicine program that connects researchers, healthcare providers, technology experts, community partners, and the public. It aims to gather longitudinal data from participants with diverse backgrounds, including age, ethnicity, lifestyle, and geographic location, to create effective individualized treatments for these groups. Participation is available at no cost to anyone living in the U.S.\ [@overview; @participants; @intro_video]

Currently, around 600,000 participants have agreed to share their electronic health records (EHR), completed the first three surveys, provided physical measurements, and donated at least one biospecimen for biobank storage. This effort has resulted in researchers gaining access to over 473,000 electronic health records and 611,000 biospecimens\ [@snapshot].

The types of data collected include\ [@data_sources; @data_browser]:

::: {style="margin-left: 2rem"}
- **Electronic Health Records:** The data is standardized following Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM) standards and is then compiled into eleven tables. These tables include information on basic demographics, visit details, conditions, device usage, labs, and procedures carried out by healthcare providers\ [@summary_methods].

- **Biosamples And Bioassays (Genomics):** Additional samples of blood, saliva, and/or urine are contributed by some participants for genomic sequencing assays.

- **Surveys:** Each participant fills out core surveys that include questions about basic demographics, socioeconomic information, tobacco, alcohol, and recreational drug use, as well as overall health and daily activities. Participants can also choose to participate in five additional surveys on behavioral health, healthcare access, and family history\ [@survey_explorer].

- **Physical Measurements:** There are three sources for physical measurements: electronic health records (EHRs), an in-person visit for baseline physical measurements, and self-reported height and weight.

- **Wearable Devices (Digital Health):** Participants can choose to share health tracking data from wearable devices, such as Fitbit, which includes physical activity levels, heart rate, and sleep patterns.

- **Partnered Research Studies:** Program partners can gather additional data and contribute it to the All of Us dataset, such as the _Exploring the Mind_ study done in partnership with the National Institute of Mental Health.

## Gaining Access

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Public Tier

#### Do I Qualify?

All individuals seeking access can download aggregated and deidentified data\ [@access_tiers].

#### Typical Timeline

It typically takes one to two weeks to process applications, though it may take longer during busy periods such as grant submission months.

#### Step-by-Step Guide

No specific steps are required to access the publicly available data, which can be found on the [Data Snapshot](https://www.researchallofus.org/data-tools/data-snapshots/) and [Data Browser](https://databrowser.researchallofus.org/?_gl=1*137ufbe*_ga*OTMwMDkxNjY5LjE3MzMxNTE0MTY.*_ga_MQVR5DG2C4*czE3NTk4NjMwMjUkbzUkZzEkdDE3NTk4NjMxNDckajUyJGwwJGgxMTk5Nzc2MzM0) webpages\ [@data_browser; @snapshot].



### Registered Tier

#### Do I Qualify?

With the Registered Tier dataset, you can access individual-level data from electronic health records (EHRs), wearables, surveys, and physical measurements through the All of Us Researcher Workbench. Researchers affiliated with institutions that have signed the All of Us Data Use and Registration Agreement (DURA) can register for access for free\ [@access_tiers].

Check the [Registered Institutions](https://www.researchallofus.org/institutional-agreements/) page to see if your institution is listed and which access level you can attain. If your institution is not listed, you can submit a request form linked on the same page\ [@aou_registered].

#### Typical Timeline

If your institution has an active DURA with All of Us at the preferred tier of access and you do not need an individual agreement, you can proceed with registering for a Workbench account and completing the training required for Registered Tier data access, which typically takes no more than a day. You will also need to set up 2-Step verification and verify your identity, with the time to complete these steps varying by researcher.

The following timeline <a href="https://support.researchallofus.org/hc/en-us/articles/9707434641044-DURA-Infographic">infographic</a> shows what to expect from a DURA application if your institution is not already registered. Refer to [Access and DURA Support Questions](https://support.researchallofus.org/hc/en-us/articles/35013049400468-Access-and-DURA-Support-Questions) for common questions about the application process\ [@support].

#### Step-by-Step Guide

Once you have a Workbench account, you need to request access to Registered Tier-level data, which involves setting up Google 2-Step Verification, verifying your identity, and completing the Responsible Conduct of Research Training\ [@access_tiers; @support].

You can find out more about the Responsible Conduct of Research Training process on the [Registration and Account Questions](https://support.researchallofus.org/hc/en-us/articles/32792489923092-Registration-and-Account-Questions) page. Identity verification can be done through Login.gov or ID.me; more details can be found on the [Identity Verification](https://support.researchallofus.org/hc/en-us/articles/4407442809876-Identity-Verification) page. If you encounter any issues, refer to the [troubleshooting](https://support.researchallofus.org/hc/en-us/articles/23968984529428-Troubleshooting-Identity-Verification-Issues) guide or contact support at support@researchallofus.org\ [@support].

After registering for a Workbench account and completing the steps to get Registered Tier-level data access, you will need to sign the Data User Code of Conduct (DUCC), which you can review [here](https://www.researchallofus.org/data-tools/data-access/?_gl=1*1o7ww0k*_ga*OTMwMDkxNjY5LjE3MzMxNTE0MTY.*_ga_MQVR5DG2C4*czE3NjAxMTExOTgkbzEwJGcxJHQxNzYwMTExMjU3JGoxJGwwJGgxNzgzOTY2NTIy) under the Data Use Policies section\ [@access_tiers].

You must annually complete refresher training, re-attest to the Data User Code of Conduct, and update your contact information and institutional affiliation to maintain access.


### Controlled Tier


#### Do I Qualify?

The Controlled Tier is an optional extension to the Registered Tier, offering access to genomic data (short-read and long-read WGS, structural variants, genotyping arrays), previously suppressed demographic data from EHRs and surveys, and unshifted event dates. Researchers affiliated with institutions that have signed the All of Us Data Use and Registration Agreement (DURA) can register for free access\ [@access_tiers].

Check the [Registered Institutions](https://www.researchallofus.org/institutional-agreements/) page to see if your institution is listed and which access level you can attain. If your institution is not listed, you can submit a request form linked on the same page\ [@aou_registered].


#### Typical Timeline

Controlled Tier access is an addition to the Registered Tier level and requires a signed agreement and permission from your institution before completing the training, which may vary for applicants. The additional training modules are not expected to take more than a day to complete.


#### Step-by-Step Guide

You will first need to complete the steps to gain Registered Tier access. Then, you will ask your institution to sign an agreement and grant permission for you to access the Controlled Tier. Once these steps are completed, you will proceed with the additional training modules specific to the Controlled Tier.

After registering for a Workbench account and completing the steps to get Registered and Controlled Tier-level data access, you will need to sign the Data User Code of Conduct (DUCC), which you can review [here](https://www.researchallofus.org/data-tools/data-access/?_gl=1*1o7ww0k*_ga*OTMwMDkxNjY5LjE3MzMxNTE0MTY.*_ga_MQVR5DG2C4*czE3NjAxMTExOTgkbzEwJGcxJHQxNzYwMTExMjU3JGoxJGwwJGgxNzgzOTY2NTIy) under the Data Use Policies section\ [@access_tiers].

You must annually complete refresher training, re-attest to the Data User Code of Conduct, and update your contact information and institutional affiliation to maintain access.
