  description: |
         </br>
         The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) collects data about the health of adults and children in the United States. This data has driven changes in medical treatment practices and public policy supporting good health\ [@about_nhanes; @achievements_nhanes]. Since its inception in 1959, NHANES has completed eight distinct iterations of the survey, with the latest being conducted as an ongoing surveillance program. These efforts have led to the creation of four special focus programs or ancillary studies.
         </br>
         </br>
         Researchers can access both publicly available and restricted data produced by NHANES from all survey installments. Moreover, researchers have the opportunity to request biospecimens collected during some surveys, allowing for the generation of additional data points that enhance the research community's resources.

## Overview

Surveillance of the dietary habits of the United States population began with the passage of the National Health Survey Act in 1956. Initially, the focus was on statistically measuring the extent, distribution, and impact of chronic illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and disabilities through three National Health Examination Surveys (NHES). The latter two cycles of NHES focused on the growth and development of children and adolescents. In the early 1970s, this scope was expanded to include research into the connections between diet and diseases with the addition of the National Nutritional Surveillance System to NHES, forming NHANES\ [@Zipf2013; @history_nhanes].

This evolution included incorporating measurements that tracked changes in nutritional status over time, alongside clinical observations and professional assessments of survey participants. The NHANES survey underwent four changes until the protocol was settled in 1999 on the continuously conducted surveillance that is still carried out today\ [@history_nhanes].

## Programs

Throughout its various iterations, NHANES, and previously NHES from 1960 to 1970, have collected a range of surveys and metrics from differently sized and demographic samples of the U.S. population. While the types of data collected, such as interviews and physician examinations, have remained consistent since the program's inception, the specific exams and tests have evolved over time. Additionally, the base population varied across iterations, with certain programs intentionally designed to oversample underrepresented ethnic and racial groups or vulnerable populations to enhance research possibilities for these groups.

All studies employed a multistage study design with stratified probability samples of loosely clustered individuals within land-based segments. Participants were randomly selected from primary sampling units (PSUs), which were further divided into segments based on geography, eligibility, and housing density. The designation of these PSUs varied with each iteration and was influenced by the intended base population for sampling inclusion. Sampling weights were generated in most iterations to reflect the national population of that stratification at the survey's midpoint\ [@nhne_design; @Linder1965; @nhanes_2019_20; @Rice1973].

Results are available in the form of interviews, surveys, physician examinations, and laboratory results. In addition to baseline socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, data collection included anthropometric measurements, medical history, standard dental, vision, and audio exams, X-rays, and blood and urine analyte panels.

### Special Focus Programs and Ancillary Studies

Most programs were intended to collect information about the United States population as a whole and its various subgroups, while sometimes oversampling age and income groups expected to be more vulnerable to malnutrition\ [@Rice1973]. The three NHES, often referred to as Cycles I-III, are essentially iterations of NHANES conducted separately to focus on specific age groups individually\ [@nhes_I; @nhes_II; @nhes_III]. 

Throughout these programs, expert evaluation panels were assembled to assess NHANES's ability to address key issues. Notably, the [Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/hhanes/default.aspx) (1982-84) was conducted as a complete NHANES iteration with the goal of improving representation among three significant U.S. Hispanic populations: Mexican-American, Cuban-American, and Puerto Rican communities\ [@hhanes; @Feinleib1985].

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Breaking Ground in Culture-Specific Research

The chapter dedicated to cross-cultural considerations, found in the [Plan and Operation of HHANES](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_01/sr01_019.pdf) documentation, acknowledged a need for cultural sensitivity and recognized unknown obstacles to implementation. It specifically noted that insufficient personnel on the core team were from or otherwise knowledgeable about the Hispanic population and cultures. This chapter highlighted that this was the first known attempt by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) to conduct a survey focused on a specific ethnic group. This document details the strategies the team employed to address these shortcomings by hiring qualified personnel and forming task force committees intended to closely evaluate aspects of the program, from translation to survey content\ [@Feinleib1985].
:::

In some cases, this prompted the consolidation of existing NHANES and NHES research, the addition of programs to enhance representation, and the initiation of ancillary studies to address specific scientific inquiries not directly supported by the primary programs. Three examples of these initiatives are the [Growth Chart (GROWTHCH)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhes123/GROWTHCH.htm) (1963-94), the [NHANES Epidemiologic Followup Study (NHEFS)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/nhefs/default.aspx) (1982-84, 1986, 1987, and 1992), and the [NHANES National Youth Fitness Survey (NNYFS)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/nnyfs12.aspx) (2012)\ [@growth_chart; @NHEFS; @NNYFS].

Results from multiple follow-ups since the completion of NHANES III in 1994 are available as the [NHANES III Augmented Data, Special Studies, and Surplus Sera Data](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/nhanes3/default.aspx). Some of these results include data generated by research groups through the NHANES Biospecimen program. All data produced with NHANES biospecimens are published as part of the ongoing list of follow-up studies. These projects cover a wide range of topics, including natality, spirometry, hipbone geometry, and sera data from surplus biospecimens\ [@nhanes_III].

Additional information about these special focus programs or ancillary studies can be found on the [NHANES Questionnaires, Datasets, and Related Documentation](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/default.aspx) webpage.

### Note on Combined Data for Longitudinal Research

A researcher seeking to use this data will need to keep in mind that each survey iteration was conducted with specific differences, where some are more cross-comparable than others. More granular differences are summarized in the [Historical NHANES Component Matrix](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/Historical_NHANES_component_matrix.pdf), which compares NHANES programs up to 2006, and the [National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey: 1999–2022 Survey Content Brochure](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/survey_contents.pdf), which summarizes the annual continuous NHANES protocol differences. Additional information is also provided in the respective programs' _Survey Methods and Analytic Guidelines_ documentation or other manuals, accessible on the CDC landing page for each program\ [@historic_nhanes_content; @continuous_brochure].

:::{.callout-caution}
One project plan for the Continuous NHANES was to allow for survey and content updates to meet emerging public health needs. It is challenging to comprehensively summarize each change made since 1999, as the program has been administered every two years since then. A generalized summary with highlights of major changes is provided in the table above.

Researchers interested in learning more about detailed protocol changes are encouraged to review the relevant documentation for each year available on the [NHANES Questionnaires, Datasets, and Related Documentation](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/default.aspx) webpage, the brochere linked above, or the [NHANES Survey Methods and Analytic Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) webpage, which consolidates some of the program's documentation\ [@data_nhanes; @nhanes_most_protocols].
:::

## Gaining Access

Most of the data available through NHES, NHANES, and the ancillary programs is publicly available for those wishing to use it for statistical analysis and reporting purposes. Researchers seeking to use the data should review and become familiar with the terms and conditions of the NCHS [Data User Agreement](#valuable-links), which covers the use of any data available from their office\ [@data_use_agreement].

Some of the more recent installments of the program offer additional levels of data with restricted access or provide researchers the option to generate their own data through the [Biospecimen Program](#valuable-links). Restricted data does not contain information that directly identifies participants, such as names, social security numbers, and addresses. However, it does include variables that could be used to identify participants when combined with other information, such as a person's job or county of residence, and sensitive information.

Explore the information provided in the tabs below for details on access steps, limitations, and time expectations specific to the types of data you are seeking to acquire.


### Publicly Available

#### Do I Qualify?

All persons seeking to use the data for statistical analysis and reporting purposes are allowed to access and download the data.


#### Step-by-Step Guide

There are no specific steps required. Simply navigate to the webpage with the NHANES program installment you want to use and download it. Be aware that specific considerations are needed to combine two different installments or biannual Continuous NHANES datasets. Refer to the relevant data documentation or any of the [webinars and tutorials](#valuable-links) available for further directions on how to best handle survey design and protocol differences.


#### Typical Timeline

There are no time constraints for accessing these data.



### Restrcited Access

#### Do I Qualify?

All individuals seeking to use the data for statistical analysis and reporting purposes are allowed to submit a research proposal to the [NCHS Research Data Center (RDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/rdc/) through the Standard Application Process (SAP) available through the ResearchDataGov (RDG) portal\ [@rdc_process; @data_release_policy].

Applicants must fulfill the following criteria during the application review process, and in some cases, after application approval. These criteria are summarized from the [RDG User Guide](https://manager.researchdatagov.org/RDG_User_Guide.pdf). If additional steps are required post-approval, the data-owning agency will contact you directly to initiate those processes.

**Identification:** Verify your identity, job title, organizational affiliation, and skill level. Some agencies require confirmation of U.S. citizenship.

**Training:** Some agencies require training on data use, data management, confidentiality, and cybersecurity following application approval.

**Agreements:** Sign agreements such as non-disclosure agreements or data use agreements. Some data sources may require the creation of a security plan outlining how the researcher will protect the data.

**Investigation:** Undergo a background check.

#### How Is My Application Assessed?

All applications submitted through SAP are evaluated against the same criteria, regardless of the agency or unit you are applying to for data, unless required by law or regulation. The full criteria are linked in the [RDG User Guide](https://manager.researchdatagov.org/RDG_User_Guide.pdf), and summarized below\ [@rdg_user_guide]:

**Statistical Purpose:** Data will be used solely for statistical purposes and not to identify individual persons or businesses, nor for law enforcement, legal cases, or regulatory actions.

**Allowed Use:** The researcher plans to use the data in compliance with the applicable rules and restrictions.

**Statistical Disclosure Limitation:** The researcher must be able to use techniques that protect the privacy of individuals, organizations, or businesses.

**Demonstrated Need:** The researcher must show that confidential data is necessary to support their project goals and that publicly available data is insufficient.

**Feasibility:** The researcher is able to achieve their project goals with the requested data. This is evaluated in three ways:

::: {style="margin-left: 2rem"}
- Project Design: Detailed methods planned and how the technical and logistical needs will be met.
- Agency or Unit Support: Confirming beforehand that the agency can support the project through space, technical help, logistics, and preparation of the data.
- Applicant Ability: The applicant has the knowledge, skills, and ability to carry out the project.
:::

**Maintaining Public Trust:** The project is expected to help maintain the public's trust and confidence in the agency or unit.


In addition to these criteria, the NCHS Review Committee will assess whether the study has a well-defined research question that addresses a public health concern, whether the results will benefit the agencies providing the data, and the appropriateness of the planned output from the study (e.g., paper, journal article, or presentation)\ [@rdc_preparing].

::: {.callout-important}
The NCHS will not evaluate your study to assess its scientific merit nor its substantive, methodological, theoretical, or policy relevance. It also does not provide guarantees that output generated by the study will be released contingent on concerns related, but not limited to, privacy and is in alignment with the approved application.

Upon receiving an application, your assigned RDC analyst and the review committee—comprising data system representatives and the confidentiality officer—will assess your application for approval, disapproval, or a request for revisions. If your application is denied by the committee, you will be provided with a justification for the decision. Researchers are allowed to request an appeal of the decision through SAP\ [@rdc_review_committee].

At some point, your study may require an amendment to the approved application. Approval for amendments typically take no more than four weeks, but can take as many as eight to twelve weeks if the amendment request is complicated.

#### Step-by-Step Guide

The RDG portal provides access to applications for data from 13 agencies and 3 units within the Federal Statistical System (FSS), including the NCHS. Each agency may have additional expectations for the application process that you will need to include if you are requesting data from them. While many details are available in the [RDG User Guide](https://manager.researchdatagov.org/RDG_User_Guide.pdf) or the [RDC Application Process](https://www.cdc.gov/rdc/application-process/index.html) webpage (some of which are summarized here), researchers are advised to contact the agencies or units from which they are requesting data before submitting their application.

Example applications, data dictionaries, and complete details can be found on the [RDC Application Process](https://www.cdc.gov/rdc/application-process/index.html) webpage\ [@rdc_process]. The summary provided here is intended solely to offer an outline and introduce you to the location of relevant  information. You can reach the RDC directly at rdca@cdc.gov for further information\ [@rdg_user_guide].

::: {style="margin-left: 2rem"}
1. Confirm that your study requires access to restricted data and that the data available through the FSS will meet your research needs. Contact all agencies or units responsible for the data to confirm that the data you need can be combined with all of the data required for your analysis, whether restricted-use, publicly available, or non-FSS.

    **NOTE:** Data access methods and locations may vary, especially if the data comes from different agencies or units within the FSS.
    
2. Decide on your preferred location of access, and confirm that you are eligible to gain access at that location. If you are not a U.S. citizen, it is recommended that you reach out to the facility where you intend to access the data prior to writing your proposal. Refer to the [Data Distribution Centers](#data-distribution-centers) section below for further details.

3. The NCHS requires additional documents as \*.pdf or \*.docx and additional concerns to be addressed beyond the base SAP application. Before starting your application, it is recommended that you prepare the following:

::: {style="margin-left: 2rem"}
- A data dictionary listing all the requested variables from publicly available, restricted-use, and non-NCHS data sources. Much of this can be created in SAP. Refer to the [Providing the Public Use and Non-NCHS Data](https://www.cdc.gov/rdc/application-process/public-use-data.html) webpage for additional guidelines on preparing your application with these types of data.
- Description of the research methodology.
- List of supporting references.
- Detailed description of the intended data product (e.g., paper, journal article, or presentation).
- Timeline for managing the project within a three-year period.
- In the **Agency Benefits** section, you must demonstrate how your project will benefit NCHS or other agencies providing the data.
- Determine and decide on your preferred access location.
:::

4. In SAP, search for and select the datasets you need for your study, then add them to your basket. Any data added to the same basket will be included in a single application.

    **NOTE:** You can add additional data to the application if needed after submission.

5. When you are ready to proceed with the application, open your basket and select **Start Application**. It is recommended that the principal investigator (PI) or co-principal investigator (co-PI) create the application, as only they will be able to make edits after submission.

6. In the application, you will need to provide researcher information, a description of the project that demonstrates the need for restricted-use data, and upload the required documents as \*.pdf or \*.docx. The standard SAP application and some agency- or unit-specific requirements can be found in the [RDG User Guide](https://manager.researchdatagov.org/RDG_User_Guide.pdf).
:::


Upon receiving the application, the RDC director will assign your group an RDC analyst who will work with you throughout the entire process of applying for data, accessing the data, and finalizing the output of your results\ [@rdc_preparing]. The RDC analyst will:

::: {style="margin-left: 2rem"}
- Facilitate the review of your application and accept your NCHS-required confidentiality paperwork.
- Accept payments incurred by accessing the data at a data center.
- Create your analytical dataset by compiling the data requested in the data dictionary and combining it based on the variables you assign for linking. This dataset will be provided to you when you visit a data center.
- After you complete your analysis at a data center, they will review your output for disclosure risk and provide you with the results.
:::


Approved applications must then complete the following steps in preparation to access and utilize the approved data.

::: {style="margin-left: 2rem"}
7. Discuss the committee's approval with your assigned RDC analyst and address any requests for revision as needed.

8. Provide the RDC analyst with the approved data dictionary, public-use and non-NCHS data, descriptions of desired data linkages with their intended final format, and clearly defined derived variables, including any arithmetic code or algorithms.

9. Complete the [Confidentiality and Disclosure](https://www.cdc.gov/rdc/application-process/confidentiality-an) training and forms, and provide them to the RDC analyst. Additional forms, documents, and tools for this step can also be found on the [RDC Reference Materials](https://www.cdc.gov/rdc/application-process/reference-materials.html) webpage\ [@rdc_reference_materials; @confid_disc].

10. When invoiced, you will need to pay the fees incurred by your request and applicable to accessing the data at your intended location and frequency of access. Refer to [Fees and Invoicing](https://www.cdc.gov/rdc/application-process/fees-and-invoicing.html) for complete details\ [@fees_invoicing].

11. Following completion of these steps, the RDC analyst will prepare your dataset. Once ready, set up an appointment to access the data at your chosen RDC location. Please schedule your appointment at least one week in advance.

    **NOTE:** Different data centers have different procedures for gaining access and might incur additional fees depending on how frequently you intend to access the data. Refer to the [Data Distribution Centers](#data-distribution-centers) section and associated links for additional guidance.

12. After completing your analysis, you must submit an output request to your RDC analyst for review and approval. Find the full details about requirements and expectations on the [Output Policies and Procedures](https://www.cdc.gov/rdc/output/index.html) webpage\ [@data_output].

    **NOTE:** The NCHS does not provide guarantees that output generated by the study will be released contingent on concerns related, but not limited to, privacy and is in alignment with the approved application.

13. When you have nearly completed your output, send it to your RDC analyst for review before submitting it for publication or distribution. Find the full details about requirements and expectations on the [Publishing Guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/rdc/publishing-guidelines/index.html) webpage\ [@publishing_guides].
:::

::: {.callout-important}
Amendments for project changes are possible but require additional approval prior to implementation. Common reasons for an amendment include, but are not limited to, changes in the research team, requests for additional variables, new methods, or requests for additional types of output\ [@rdc_process].  However, if you wish to change the scope or research question, a new application is required instead.

Contact the RDC directly at rdca@cdc.gov for further guidance.
:::


#### Data Distribution Centers

NCHS data is available at two types of data centers: the Census Bureau's Federal Statistical Research Data Centers (FSRDC) and the NCHS Research Data Centers (RDCs). Additional details about preparing to access your data at one of these sites can be found on the RDC [Location of Access](https://www.cdc.gov/rdc/location-of-access/index.html) webpage or their respective subpages: [FSRDC](https://www.cdc.gov/rdc/location-of-access/federal-statistical-rdc.html) and [NCHS RDC](https://www.cdc.gov/rdc/location-of-access/nchs-rdc.html)\ [@data_locations; @fsrdc; @nchs_rdc; @rdc_process].


::: {.callout-important}
You must submit an electronic copy of any notes or reference materials you need to your RDC analyst prior to visiting a center. Hard copies of these materials are not allowed. You are also not allowed to bring electronic communication devices, such as phones, pagers, laptops, into the RDC.
