## Overview

The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is the nation's principal health statistics agency. It collects and disseminates data to provide a comprehensive understanding of health and healthcare in the United States. NCHS gathers information from various sources, including birth and death records, medical records, interviews, physical examinations, and laboratory testing\ [@main_page; @about; @data_tools].

Policymakers and public health professionals use NCHS data to identify health problems and develop policies and programs. The data is shared through reports, dashboards, and data files, measuring the health of the U.S. population, monitoring health trends, identifying disparities, documenting healthcare access and usage, supporting research, and guiding public policies and programs\ [@about].



## Gaining Access

The program manages six crucial datasets for public health, each with its own information page detailing the programs and data offerings\ [@main_page; @data_tools]. You can find more about how to gain access to these program data on their respective pages from the [Dataset](../../../datasets/index.html) main page. They are:
