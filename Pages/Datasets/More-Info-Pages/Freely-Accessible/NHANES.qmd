  title: "National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey"
  description: |
         </br>
         The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) collects data about the health of adults and children in the United States. We also collect data about what participants eat, drink, and take as supplements to determine how many nutrients are in their diet. These dietary interviews and blood tests help us measure the nutritional status of U.S. adults and children\ [@about_nhanes; @achievements_nhanes].
         </br>
         </br>
         CDC's <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/index.html">National Center for Health Statistics</a> (NCHS) conducts NHANES. NHANES is the only national health survey that includes health exams, laboratory tests, and dietary interviews for participants of all ages.
         </br>
         </br>
         NHANES data can help improve the health of Americans. Survey data have driven changes in how doctors treat patients and how public policy supports good health.

## Overview

Surveillance of the dietary habits of the United States population began with the passage of the National Health Survey Act in 1956. Initially, the focus was on statistically measuring the extent, distribution, and impact of chronic illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and disabilities through three National Health Examination Surveys (NHES). The latter two cycles of NHES focused on the growth and development of children and adolescents. In the early 1970s, this scope was expanded to include research into the connections between diet and diseases with the addition of the National Nutritional Surveillance System to NHES, forming NHANES\ [@Zipf2013; @history_nhanes].

This evolution included incorporating measurements that tracked changes in nutritional status over time, alongside clinical observations and professional assessments of survey participants. The NHANES survey underwent four changes until the protocol was settled in 1999 on the continuously conducted surveillance that is still carried out today\ [@history_nhanes].

## Programs

Through its different iterations, NHANES, and previously NHES from 1960 to 1970, collected various surveys and metrics from differently sized and demographic samplings of the U.S. population. A researcher seeking to use this data will need to keep in mind that each survey iteration was conducted with specific differences, where some are more cross-comparable than others. We briefly discuss these differences here, but additional methadological variations can be found by reviewing the references provided below.

### Methods and Representational Differences

The following table summarizes critical program features and highlights changes or differences between each program iteration. Although the data types, such as interviews and physician examinations, have remained consistent since the program's inception, the kinds and scope of exams and tests have changed. The base population also varied, with certain programs intentionally designed to oversample underrepresented ethnic and racial groups or vulnerable populations to improve research possibilities for these groups.

We do not spend time distinguishing methodological differences if the same type of exam was conducted with different instruments or protocols. Researchers interested in learning more about these granular differences to assess the possibility of cross-program compatibility are recommended to review the [Historical NHANES Component Matrix](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/Historical_NHANES_component_matrix.pdf), which compares NHANES programs up to 2006, and the [National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey: 1999â€“2022 Survey Content Brochure](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/survey_contents.pdf), which summarizes the annual continuous NHANES protocol differences. Additional information is also provided in the respective programs' _Survey Methods and Analytic Guidelines_ documentation or other manuals, accessible on the CDC landing page for each program\ [@historic_nhanes_content; @continuous_brochure].

              <strong>NOTE:</strong> Generally speaking, any 2-year data cycle in Continuous NHANES can be combined with adjacent 2-year data cycles utilizing the same sampling design to create analytic data files based on 4 or more years of data, allowing for greater precision. Protocols are provided in respective documentation to provide direction on how to best combine historical Continuous NHANES data with more current iterations.

              <strong>NOTE:</strong> Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the 2019-20 Continuous NHANES series was suspended in March 2020. Consequently, only 18 of 30 PSUs were recorded, rendering the sample not nationally representative. To compensate, the 2017-March 2020 Pre-pandemic dataset was created. Users should be aware that combining these programs introduces new challenges due to differences in sampling methods and time spans. For additional details, refer to the [2017â€“March 2020 Prepandemic File: Sample Design, Estimation, and Analytic Guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_02/sr02-190.pdf) for additional details\ [@Akinbami2017].

One project plan for the Continuous NHANES was to allow for survey and content updates to meet emerging public health needs. It is challenging to comprehensively summarize each change made since 1999, as the program has been administered every two years since then. A generalized summary with highlights of major changes is provided in the table below. Researchers interested in learning more about detailed protocol changes are encouraged to review the relevant documentation for each year available on the [NHANES Questionnaires, Datasets, and Related Documentation](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/default.aspx) webpage, the brochere linked above, or the [NHANES Survey Methods and Analytic Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) webpage, which consolidates some of the program's documentation\ [@data_nhanes; @nhanes_most_protocols].
:::


### Special Focus Programs and Ancillary Studies

Most programs were intended to collect information about the United States population as a whole and its various subgroups, while sometimes oversampling age and income groups expected to be more vulnerable to malnutrition\ [@Rice1973]. The three NHES, often referred to as Cycles I-III, are essentially iterations of NHANES conducted separately to focus on specific age groups individually\ [@nhes_I; @nhes_II; @nhes_III]. Throughout these programs, expert evaluation panels were assembled to assess NHANES's ability to address key issues\ [@Feinleib1985].

In some cases, this warranted the consolidation of existing NHANES and NHES research, the addition of programs to enhance representation, and ancillary studies to address specific scientific inquiries not directly supported by the primary programs. These are summarized below, and additional information can be found on the [NHANES Questionnaires, Datasets, and Related Documentation](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/default.aspx) webpage.

#### Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES) 1982-84

After the completion of NHANES II in 1980, an expert panel recommended that the next program focus on the health and nutritional status of a specific subpopulation. Different groups were considered, and it was determined that the Hispanic population should be the focus due to notable gaps in comparable data for this population. This was partly due to insufficient representation of Hispanic populations and a lack of separate representation for Mexican-American, Cuban-American, and Puerto Rican communities. HHANES was formulated with the explicit purpose of supporting estimations of the health and nutritional status of the United States Hispanic population so that it is comparable with the general population, while also considering variations between these three specific Hispanic communities\ [@Feinleib1985].

Additional study design and content details are provided earlier in the [Methods and Representational Differences](#methods-and-representational-differences) section.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
The chapter dedicated to cross-cultural considerations, found in the [Plan and Operation of HHANES](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_01/sr01_019.pdf) documentation, acknowledged a need for cultural sensitivity and recognized unknown obstacles to implementation. It specifically noted that insufficient personnel on the core team were from or otherwise knowledgeable about the Hispanic population and cultures. This chapter highlighted that this was the first known attempt by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) to conduct a survey focused on a specific ethnic group. This document details the strategies the team employed to address these shortcomings by hiring qualified personnel and forming task force committees intended to closely evaluate aspects of the program, from translation to survey content\ [@Feinleib1985].
