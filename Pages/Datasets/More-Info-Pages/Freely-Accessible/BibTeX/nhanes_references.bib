   abstract = {Background
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) produces national estimates that are representative of the total noninstitutionalized civilian U.S. population. The NHANES sample is selected using a complex, four-stage sample design. NHANES sample weights are used by analysts to produce estimates of the health statistics that would have been obtained if the entire sampling frame (the noninstitutionalized civilian U.S. population) had been surveyed. Sampling errors should be calculated for all survey estimates to assess their statistical reliability. Variance approximation procedures are required to provide reasonable, approximately unbiased, and design-consistent variance estimates for complex sample surveys like NHANES. The 2017–March 2020 files represent a unique public use data release from NHANES. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic required suspension of data collection in March 2020. As a result, the partially completed NHANES 2019–2020 cycle was not nationally representative. Therefore, the 2019–March 2020 data were combined with the data from the 2017–2018 cycle to create the nationally representative 2017–March 2020 prepandemic data files.

Objective
This report describes the creation of the NHANES 2017–March 2020 prepandemic data files, including the selection of the appropriate NHANES sample design (2015–2018) to create sample weights and variance units for public-use data files. Additionally, the development of a factor applied to the primary sampling units to adjust the 2017–March 2020 data to fit the NHANES 2015–2018 sample design is described. Analyses to assess representativeness of the target population were performed, and a simulation to replicate the impact of interrupted data collection using earlier NHANES cycles was undertaken. Analytic guidance specific to use for prepandemic data files is also included.},

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a periodic survey conducted by NCHS. The third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), conducted from 1988 through 1994, was the seventh in a series of these surveys based on a complex, multi-stage sample plan. It was designed to provide national estimates of the health and nutritional status of the United States' civilian, noninstitutionalized population aged two months and older.

Data from NHANES III are being released in five public release data files:
- NHANES III Household Adult Data File (Catalog Number 77560)
- NHANES III Household Youth Data File (Catalog Number 77550)
- NHANES III Examination Data File (Catalog Number 76200)

Background
The purpose of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is to produce national estimates representative of the total noninstitutionalized civilian U.S. population. The sample for NHANES is selected using a complex, four-stage sample design. NHANES sample weights are used by analysts to produce estimates of the health-related statistics that would have been obtained if the entire sampling frame (i.e., the noninstitutionalized civilian U.S. population) had been surveyed. Sampling errors should be calculated for all survey estimates to aid in determining their statistical reliability. For complex sample surveys, exact mathematical formulas for variance estimates that fully incorporate the sample design are usually not available. Variance approximation procedures are required to provide reasonable, approximately unbiased, and designconsistent estimates of variance.

Objective
This report describes the NHANES 2015−2018 sample design and the methods used to create sample weights and variance units for the public-use data files, including sample weights for selected subsamples, such as the fasting subsample. The impacts of sample design changes on estimation for NHANES 2015−2018 are described. Approaches that data users can use to modify sample weights when combining survey cycles or when combining subsamples are also included.},

Background
Data collection for the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) consists of a household screener, an interview, and a physical examination. The screener primarily determines whether any household members are eligible for the interview and examination. Eligibility is established using preset selection probabilities for the desired demographic subdomains. After an eligible sample person is selected, the interview collects person-level demographic, health, and nutrition information, as well as information about the household. The examination includes physical measurements, tests such as hearing and dental examinations, and the collection of blood and urine specimens for laboratory testing.

Objectives
This report provides some background on the NHANES program, beginning with the first survey cycle in the 1970s and highlighting significant changes since its inception. The report then describes the broad design specifications for the 2011–2014 survey cycle, including survey objectives, domain and precision specifications, and operational requirements unique to NHANES. The report also describes details of the survey design, including the calculation of sampling rates and sample selection methods. Documentation of survey content, data collection procedures, estimation methods, and methods to assess nonsampling errors are reported elsewhere.},

Background
Starting in 1999, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) became a continuous, ongoing annual survey of the noninstitutionalized civilian resident population of the United States. A continuous survey allowed content to change to meet emerging needs.

Objective
This report describes how NHANES for 1999–2010 was designed and implemented. NHANES is a national survey designed to provide national estimates on various health-related topics.

Methods
The survey used in-person face-to-face interviews and physical examinations for data collection. Approximately 5,000 people per year participated in NHANES. The 5,000 people surveyed each year are representative of the entire U.S. population.},
