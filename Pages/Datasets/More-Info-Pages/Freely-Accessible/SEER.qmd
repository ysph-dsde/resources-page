## Overview

The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) is supported by the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) Surveillance Research Program (SRP), which provides national leadership in cancer surveillance science and offers the tools and expertise necessary for collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and disseminating reliable population-based statistics. Since 1973, SEER has provided vital cancer statistics, growing to cover 45.9% of the US population across 22 geographic areas with its data on cancer incidence and survival. To date, they have recorded as many as approximately 17 million cases in some of their registries, almost 16 million of which represent malignant cases\ [@about_seer; @program_overview].

SEER data includes patient demographics, tumor characteristics, initial treatments, and survival outcomes, offering significant representation of various racial and ethnic groups across the nation\ [@data_variables; @program_overview]. The data is collected from participating cancer registries, which can be either population-based or hospital-based, with special registries focusing on specific cancers\ [@registries].

The types of data products available include\ [@data_apps; @data_variables; @data_comparisons; @us_data]:

::: {style="margin-left: 2rem"}
- **SEER Research Data:** The standard SEER data, which provides information on cancer incidence and survival from population-based cancer registries. The data encompasses patient demographics, primary tumor site, tumor morphology, stage at diagnosis, extent and history of the disease, initial treatments, and survival outcomes.

- **SEER Research Plus and NCCR Data:** This expanded category includes all the SEER Research Data as well as additional variables and detailed information not included in the standard dataset, such as geography, month in addition to year of diagnosis, and other demographic fields. It also encompasses data from the National Childhood Cancer Registry (NCCR), offering a more comprehensive dataset for in-depth research, including more variables related to specific cancer types and treatments.

- **Supplementary Datasets:** Data commonly used with to SEER or NCCR, including U.S. Mortality, U.S. Populations, Standard Populations, County/Tract Attributes, Expected Survival, and SEER Linked Databases. The Linked Databases include SEER-Medicare, SEER-Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (SEER-MHOS), SEER-Medicaid, and SEER-Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (SEER-CAHPS).

- **Specialized Datasets:** Specialized Datasets include additional variables not found in the standard SEER Research Data and require access to the latest SEER Research Plus Data. Available databases cover various specific cancers and attributes, such as Pharyngeal Cancer with HPV Status, Prostate Cancer with additional fields, and Incidence Data with Census Tract Attributes, with some requiring NCI Central IRB approval\ [@specialized_data_login].
:::

The types of data collected and represented in these include\ [@data_variables]: 

::: {style="margin-left: 2rem"}
- **Demographic Data:** Basic demographics like age, gender, race, socioeconomic status, family characteristics, and geographic location information such as state and urbanicity.

- **Survival Outcomes:** Information on the patient’s survival status and follow-up data, including the length of survival and cause of death.

- **Tumor Characteristics:**  Details about the primary tumor site, morphology, stage at diagnosis, extent and history of the disease, and other relevant attributes.

- **Initial Treatments:** Data on the first course of treatment administered to patients, including surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.
:::

In addition to its data, SEER has created software tools and webpages designed to simplify data access, analysis, and dissemination. They also interface with SEER data and other cancer-related databases for facilitating data retrieval and analyses\ [@explorer_tools; @methods_tools; @data_software].

::: {style="margin-left: 2rem"}
- **SEER\*Explorer:** A webpage that provides SEER cancer summary statistics by race, age, sex, stage, and cancer subtypes, covering 46% of the U.S. population.

- **NCCR\*Explorer:** A webpage that provides childhood, adolescent and young adult cancer summary statistics from National Childhood Cancer Registry (NCCR) data for ages 0-39 using International Classification of Childhood Cancer (ICCC).

- **SEER\*Stat:** A computer software for analyzing SEER data and other cancer-related databases, specializing in endopoints about incidence rates, survival, and prevelance.

- **SEERPrep:** Converts user-supplied ASCII text data files to SEERStat database format.

- **SEER Data Management System (SEER\*DMS):** Supports all core cancer registry functions including importing data, editing, linkage, consolidation, and reporting.
