      - title: The Health Attribution Library
        description: |
          We compile studies that conduct end-to-end attribution studies on the human health impacts of human-caused climate change. The Health Attribution Library is a living resource, meant to provide evidence in support of scientific research, journalism, public interest, litigation, and political negotiations.

      - title: Worldwide Index of Serotype Specific Pneumococcal Antibody Responses (WISSPAR)
        description: |
          The Worldwide Index of Serotype Specific Pneumococcal Antibody Responses (WISSPAR) is a centralized platform housing data on immunogenicity from clinical trials of pneumococcal vaccines. The data on WISSPAR are primarily curated from outcomes tables from clinicaltrials.gov and are made available in a searchable format that can be readily used for downstream analyses. Fields included in the database include product, manufacturers, dosing schedule, age group, and geographic region. You can use the embedded tools to generate customizable visualizations, export data for further analyses, or just browse through clinical trial results.

        description: |
          Nextstrain is an open-source project to harness the scientific and public health potential of pathogen genome data. Here are a few of our ongoing ‘community’ Nextstrain projects. Note that most of these analyses are preliminary, so interpret with caution. We love to collaborate – contact us if you’d like to join one of these exciting projects!

          In our opinion, good science isn’t done in a vacuum. Sharing information among our peers is critical for responding to a public health crisis and understanding the mechanisms driving emerging diseases. We’ll release our virus genetic data and any useful protocols or analysis tools as soon as they are generated. Please note that because these are usually early releases (pre-publication), they may contain mistakes. We’ll make protocols, analysis tools, and data available as they are developed.

          The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) collects data about the health of adults and children in the United States. We also collect data about what participants eat, drink, and take as supplements to determine how many nutrients are in their diet. These dietary interviews and blood tests help us measure the nutritional status of U.S. adults and children.
          </br>
          CDC's National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) conducts NHANES. NHANES is the only national health survey that includes health exams, laboratory tests, and dietary interviews for participants of all ages.
          </br>
          NHANES data can help improve the health of Americans. Survey data have driven changes in how doctors treat patients and how public policy supports good health.
