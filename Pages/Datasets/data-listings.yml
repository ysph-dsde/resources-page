# Filter/search behavior with the ejs file:
#   - Filter by three categories: 1. region and/or affiliation, 2. dataset 
#     content type, and 3. accessibility (i.e. restricted-use, license)
#   - Sort tiles by "title" and "date-updated". The user can
#     control how these two characteristics are sorted.
#   - Default sorting of the tiles is by "ranking" (ascending) then "title"
#     (A-Z)
# 
# 
# When adding new tiles:
#   - Under "items" each entry requires association with all three categories
#     and metadata that gets added under "tiles" |-> "- title: ** ".
#   - Group tiles with the SAME three categories together under the same "tiles".
#     This causes all tiles listed under that subsection to get filtered together
#     when the user selectes any or all three categories.
#   - Mandatory "tiles" |-> "- title: ** " fields: "title", "description", 
#     "date-added", "date-updated", "ranking," "image", "topic" to list the 
#     second category.
#   - Opional "tiles" |-> "- title: ** " fields: "site" for the main webpage for 
#     the source, "group" for the lab or group webpage who provides the source,
#     "github" for the codebase repository, "article" if there primary articles
#     presenting the resource by the creators, and "info" that links to an
#     internal page with additional details about the resource.
# 
# When editing existing tiles:
#   - Ensure that the new links work as expected.
#   - Change the "date-updated" entry for the tile you edited.
#   - Change the "last updated" sections at the top of the page.

          The Worldwide Index of Serotype Specific Pneumococcal Antibody Responses (WISSPAR) is a centralized platform housing data on immunogenicity from clinical trials of pneumococcal vaccines. The data on WISSPAR are primarily curated from outcomes tables from clinicaltrials.gov and are made available in a searchable format that can be readily used for downstream analyses. Fields included in the database include product, manufacturers, dosing schedule, age group, and geographic region. You can use the embedded tools to generate customizable visualizations, export data for further analyses, or just browse through clinical trial results.

          In our opinion, good science isn’t done in a vacuum. Sharing information among our peers is critical for responding to a public health crisis and understanding the mechanisms driving emerging diseases. We’ll release our virus genetic data and any useful protocols or analysis tools as soon as they are generated. Please note that because these are usually early releases (pre-publication), they may contain mistakes. We’ll make protocols, analysis tools, and data available as they are developed.

          The National Center for Health Statistics is the nation's source for official health statistics. We collect, analyze, and share data and statistics to guide programs and policies that improve the health of people across the United States. NCHS collects data from many sources of health information: birth and death records, medical records, interviews with people and healthcare providers, direct physical examinations, and laboratory testing. NCHS shares data, statistics, and analysis in multiple ways, including reports, dashboards, and data files. Including: Family Growth Survey, Health Care Surveys, Rapid Surveys, Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, Health Interview Survey, Vital Statistics, and a special compilation of linked surveys with administrative data. Here we specifically list the surveys that are not open access only.

        description: |
         The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) collects data about the health of adults and children in the United States. This data has driven changes in medical treatment practices and public policy supporting good health . Since its inception in 1959, NHANES has completed eight distinct iterations of the survey, with the latest being conducted as an ongoing surveillance program. These efforts have led to the creation of four special focus programs or ancillary studies.
         </br>
         </br>
         Researchers can access both publicly available and restricted data produced by NHANES from all survey installments. Moreover, researchers have the opportunity to request biospecimens collected during some surveys, allowing for the generation of additional data points that enhance the research community's resources.

          The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) monitors the health of people across the country—the U.S. population—by collecting and analyzing data on a broad range of health topics. NHIS focuses on the health of U.S. children and adults.
          </br>
          </br>
          CDC's National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) conducts NHIS. It is the nation's largest and oldest national health survey. NHIS began collecting data in 1957.
          </br>
          </br>
          Each year, NHIS collects data from about 27,000 adults through confidential, face-to-face interviews throughout the year. Many of these adults also provide health information about children in their households.
          </br>
          </br>
          NHIS collects data from civilians who don't live in institutions. Civilians are people not serving on active duty in the military. Institutionalized people live in places like correctional facilities, skilled-nursing homes, and mental (psychiatric) hospitals.

          Overview: The National Health Care Surveys are a family of surveys that provide information about—
          </br>
          - Organizations and providers that deliver health care
          - The healthcare services they provide
          - The patients they serve across diverse healthcare settings
          - Researchers, policymakers, and health professionals can use data from our surveys to understand providers, patients, and management and delivery of patient care in the United States.

          The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) fields Rapid Surveys fast and often. We can easily adapt these surveys to collect specific information as needs arise. This makes evidence-based decision making better and faster for those working to protect and improve health in the United States.
          </br>
          </br>
          Rapid Surveys can be used to—
          </br>
          - Collect data on niche, emerging, or priority health topics
          - Close health information gaps
          - Learn how values and beliefs can affect access, care, and wellness
          - Assess questionnaire design to ensure data collection is meaningful
          - By getting the right data in the right hands at the right time, the NCHS Rapid Surveys System is helping make science more responsive and actionable.

          The National Vital Statistics System is the oldest and most successful example of inter-governmental data sharing in Public Health and the shared relationships, standards, and procedures form the mechanism by which NCHS collects and disseminates the Nation’s official vital statistics. These data are provided through contracts between NCHS and vital registration systems operated in the various jurisdictions legally responsible for the registration of vital events – births, deaths, marriages, divorces, and fetal deaths. Vital Statistics data are also available online. In the United States, legal authority for the registration of these events resides individually with the 50 States, 2 cities (Washington, DC, and New York City), and 5 territories (Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands). These jurisdictions are responsible for maintaining registries of vital events and for issuing copies of birth, marriage, divorce, and death certificates.
