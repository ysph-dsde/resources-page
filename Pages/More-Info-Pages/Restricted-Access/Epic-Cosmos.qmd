## Overview

Cosmos is a comprehensive dataset that compiles records voluntarily contributed by health systems using Epic for electronic medical record (EMR) management. More than just a data repository, Cosmos provides a complete data warehouse and analytical infrastructure, including tools such as SlicerDicer and the Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM), designed to facilitate scientific discoveries and advance medicine\ [@epic_cosmos_about; @ybic_cosmos].

The network currently encompasses nearly 2,000 hospitals across the country and globally, with almost half a million physicians caring for approximately 300 million patients. This collaboration creates a dataset containing billions of high-quality, representative, longitudinal clinical data points\ [@epic_community]. Notably, the patient demographics represented in Cosmos closely align with those of the United States Census, enhancing its research utility\ [@epic_overview]. All participating organizations and members of the Cosmos Governing Council can be viewed on the [Cosmos Community](https://cosmos.epic.com/community/) page\ [@epic_community].

Epic Cosmos combines inpatient and outpatient charts into unified, longitudinal patient records while removing duplicates that may arise from patients receiving care at multiple Cosmos organizations. The data provided to researchers adheres to [HIPAA-defined limited data set](https://privacyruleandresearch.nih.gov/pr_08.asp) standards\ [@epic_overview]. To enhance patient privacy protections, the de-identified dataset suppresses geographic information, consistently shifts patient dates, and conceals source organizations. Detailed information on individual data element transformation processes is available in the [Cosmos Data Domain Encyclopedia](https://galaxy.epic.com/Redirect.aspx?DocumentID=100198880&PrefDocID=156634) and the [Data Dictionary](https://galaxy.epic.com/Search/GetFile?url=1%2168%21100%21100149584&from=KitMembers) (also accessible through the Cosmos portal)\ [@epic_cosmos_data_encyclopedia; @epic_data_dictionary].

The [Cosmos Overview](https://galaxy.epic.com/Redirect.aspx?DocumentID=100278332&PrefDocID=167630) page provides an invaluable introduction to Epic's resource, outlining essential information for both non-sponsored and third-party sponsored research projects\ [@epic_overview]. This includes guidance on Cosmos data usage, project tracking procedures, and publication expectations, with additional details available in the corresponding data access level sections on this webpage.

The types of data collected in the EMR are continuously expanding. For example, researchers currently have access to the following data\ [@epic_overview]:

::: {style="margin-left: 2rem"}
- **Patient Information:** Limited demographic details such as age, sex, gender identity, race, ethnicity, location, patient status, and family history, social history elements like tobacco and substance use, birth control, social determinants of health, allergy information, and detailed birth history.

- **Visits and Encounters:** Patient encounters and admissions including encounter type, classification, department and provider specialties, and visit reasons, as well as clinical notes from various medical documentation and patient experience data from MyChart usage and patient-reported outcomes.

- **Medical Data:** Diagnoses, clinical and billed procedures, and vital signs such as blood pressure, pulse, temperature, respiratory rate, SpO2 levels, height, weight, BMI, and head circumference.

- **Lab and Genomics:** Lab results such as component-specific results, susceptibility results, and reference ranges, in addition to genomic variant data like allelic state and chromosome details, and biosamples for genomic assays including blood, saliva, and urine samples.

- **Health Assessments:** Information on cancer staging, immunizations, and eye exams, with details on stage group, immunization type, and visual acuity.

- **Specialty Data:** Records data on hospital-acquired infections and various infection types, surgical procedures, transplant data for liver and kidney transplants, and health tracking data from wearable devices.

- **Research and Analytics:** Geographic factors like RUCA and Social Vulnerability Index, risk scores for conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and data from research studies detailing study type, enrollment, and partnered research contributions.

- **Miscellaneous:** Encompasses peer group information on various types of hospitals, medication data including prescriptions and patient-reported medications, and additional lab results.

## Gaining Access

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Cosmos Basic Access

#### Do I Qualify?

Basic access provides users with entry to the Cosmos data portal, allowing them to query the limited dataset using SlicerDicer, create dashboards with custom elements, and share dashboards with other Cosmos users\ [@epic_setup_guide].

While Yale University-Yale New Haven Hospital System (YU-YNHHS) manages access to YNHHS Epic data through Research Basic Access (RBA), Epic coordinates with YU-YNHHS to manage researcher access to Epic Cosmos data. According to their rules, any researcher seeking access to Epic Cosmos must already have RBA to the YNHHS Epic data. Full instructions for obtaining RBA are available on our [Yale New Haven Health System (YNHHS) Epic](YNHHS-Epic.qmd) information webpage\ [@epic_granting_access].

Researchers in the "Your Community" category (directly affiliated partners) may require additional review by the Cosmos Governing Council to gain access to Epic Cosmos. External Collaborators (e.g., pharma employees, contractors, etc.) are typically not intended to have access to Epic Cosmos, but special approval requests can be submitted to the Cosmos Governing Council. These qualification tiers are illustrated in Epic's infographic below\ [@epic_granting_access].

#### Typical Timeline

CITI training completion typically takes 1-2 weeks, as the training is comprehensive and involved. Once completed, certificates take no more than 2 business days to be reflected in Workday. Note that recognition timing may vary if training is completed outside of Workday\ [@yale_human_subject].

#### Step-by-Step Guide

This page assumes researchers have RBA. Follow the [YNHHS Epic](YNHHS-Epic.qmd) webpage instructions to obtain RBA if needed.

**a: Complete Yale's HIPAA Training**

::: {style="margin-left: 2rem"}
**For Yale NetID holders:** Complete the [HIPAA Privacy and Security](https://hipaa.yale.edu/training/training-modules) courses in Workday, including the basic privacy and security module, followed by the role-specific module (e.g., for clinicians or researchers)\ [@yale_hippa].

**For Non-Yale NetID holders:** Read and sign the [HIPAA Privacy and Security](https://hipaa.yale.edu/training/training-modules) training materials specific to your role on the project (e.g., for clinicians or researchers). Submission directions for these documents can be found on the accompanying PDF\ [@yale_hippa].
:::


**b: Obtain a Human Subjects Protection Training (HSPT) Certificate from CITI**

A Human Subjects Protection Training (HSPT) certificate from CITI completed within the last three years is required. Below is a summary of the process, and the complete directions can be found on the [It's Your Yale](https://your.yale.edu/research-support/human-research-protection-program/education-and-training/human-research-training) page about HSPT\ [@yale_human_subject].

Researchers need to complete the following CITI certificates:

::: {style="margin-left: 2rem"}
-   "Basic Training"
-   One of the following two initial/basic Human Subjects Research modules: "Biomedical Research Basic" or "Social Behavioral Educational Researchers Basic".
:::

If CITI certification was completed at another institution, a copy should be emailed to [irb.training@yale.edu](mailto:irb.training@yale.edu) before proceeding to Section C. For further inquiries, the same email address can be used.

If you have not yet received an HSPT certificate or if your certificate is more than three years old, you will need to complete the training in CITI. First, access CITI or link your CITI account with your Yale Workday account.

**b.i: Accessing CITI and Linking It**

::: {style="margin-left: 2rem"}
**For Yale Employees:** It is preferable, though not required, to access the CITI training modules through Workday. This will expedite the recognition of the certificate in the Yale Integrated Research Enterprise Solution (IRES) IRB system.

::: {style="margin-left: 2rem"}
1. Open the [Learning Homepage](https://www.myworkday.com/yale/learning) in Workday.

2. The CITI training link will appear as the "Human Subjects Protection Training – Initial/Refresher" course under the "Required Training" section. If it does not appear, ensure that your name is listed in the IRES IRB pending study or submission. If it still does not appear, contact your manager or reach out to [learning@yale.edu](mailto:learning@yale.edu) or [irb.training@yale.edu](mailto:irb.training@yale.edu) to request a manual assignment.

:::{.callout-note}
If available, complete the "Compliance Assessment" to indicate that you are conducting human subjects research.
:::

3. Once the "Human Subjects Protection Training – Initial/Refresher" course page is accessed, the "Enroll" button should be clicked to proceed.

4. A button labeled "Start Program", or "Retake Program" if being taken as a refresher, will appear under the course photo. Click it to proceed.

5. Log into [CITI](https://www.citiprogram.org/index.cfm?pageID=668) using the "Yale University Training Opportunities" Single Sign-On (SSO).
:::

**For Non-Yale Employees:** Non-Yale employees should access CITI through their own institution or directly via the [main webpage](https://about.citiprogram.org/). Pursuing certification independently may incur charges. Current costs for CITI courses can be found on the [Explore Our Courses](https://about.citiprogram.org/courses/?reset=true) webpage\ [@citi_courses].
:::

**b.ii: Register for the Certification**

Once access to CITI courses is granted, follow these steps to complete the certification:

::: {style="margin-left: 2rem"}
a. In CITI, select "Add a Course" and scroll to the bottom to find the initial/basic CITI HSP Training under the Human Subjects Research heading.

b. Indicate the intent to take a Human Subjects Research course and select either "Biomedical Research" or "Social Behavioral Educational Researchers." When prompted, confirm the selection of the "Biomedical Research-Basic Course."

c. Complete the course modules and achieve a passing grade of at least 70% on the assessment.

d. If the Workday account was not linked with CITI, save the completion certificate and send it to [irb.training@yale.edu](mailto:irb.training@yale.edu). If accessed through Workday, the record should auto-update.
:::


**c: Mastering SlicerDicer in the Cosmos Environment**

Individuals are expected to have completed the YNHHS Epic RBA application process, including all mandatory training for that level of access. YNHH and Joint Data Analytics Team (JDAT) provide training specifically tailored for the YNHHS Epic portal within the YNHH Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI), which differs from the training provided by Epic for similar analytic tools available in the Cosmos data portal, such as SlicerDicer\ [@epic_setup_guide; @epic_setup_guide_training].

#### Accessing Epic Cosmos
Access to the Epic Cosmos SlicerDicer is through the Epic Cosmos portal, not the YNHH VDI. You can open this portal from the [Epic UserWeb](https://userweb.epic.com/) by navigating to the "Show All" drop-down menu and selecting "Cosmos" under the "Support" section.

If you encounter any issues logging into Cosmos, please contact JDAT for assistance. If the issue persists, reach out to [CosmosUserRequests@Epic.com](#mailto:CosmosUserRequests@Epic.com).


#### Initiating Collaborative Projects

Researchers with Cosmos Basic Access can share code and datasets with peers who are collaborators on specific research questions\ [@epic_collaborating]. These collaboration networks are created using the Cosmos **Projects** tool. Directions on how to create and maintain projects can be found in the ["Cosmos Tip Sheet: Create and Monitor Projects"](https://galaxy.epic.com/Redirect.aspx?DocumentID=100061177&PrefDocID=127868)\ [@create_monitor_projects].

Certified Cosmos Data Science users can share code with the entire Cosmos community via Cosmos's GitLab. For more details, please refer to the Data Science certificate tab below.

#### Publications Expectations

Epic provides data users with a checklist for preparing data for publications, emphasized in the user agreement, ["Cosmos Rules of the Road"](https://galaxy.epic.com/Redirect.aspx?DocumentID=4024320&PrefDocID=113401). The full instructions and expectations can be found in the Galaxy ["Cosmos Publication Checklist"](https://galaxy.epic.com/Redirect.aspx?DocumentID=100130418&PrefDocID=145166) article and the "Cosmos Rules of the Road", which outlines some of the Data Use Agreement terms\ [@epic_publication_checklist; @epic_rules_of_road].

::: {.callout-tip}
## Data Privacy: Low Count Suppression

When transferring results off the VDI or sharing SlicerDicer graphs, it is imperative to follow Epic's process to prevent the exportation of line-level data. No counts less than 10 can be individually noted (report as <11).

Review the [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Cell Size Suppression Policy](https://resdac.org/articles/cms-cell-size-suppression-policy) outlined by the Research Data Assistance Center (ResDAC) for examples of how to appropriately suppress low counts\ [@cms_supression_policy].
:::

::: {.callout-important}
## Reporting Citations of Your Findings

Researchers are obligated to provide a list of citations for any publications or references to their research conducted using Cosmos. This list must be submitted to the Governing Council on a semi-annual basis\ [@epic_rules_of_road].
:::

:::


## Additional Certifications

Individuals have the opportunity to obtain additional certifications beyond a Cosmos Basic Access account, granting them extra permissions and capabilities with Epic data\ [@epic_setup_guide]. For YNHHS employees, obtaining Super User certification is mandatory, and it is highly encouraged for all YU employees\ [@ynhhs_course_catalog].

As previously noted, detailed training requirements, role descriptions, and expectations can be found in the Cosmos Setup and Support Guide under the [Cosmos Training and Support](https://galaxy.epic.com/Redirect.aspx?DocumentID=100170435&PrefDocID=97645) section.

A Data Architect is expected to be knowledgeable about the Cosmos data model, write SQL queries against the de-identified database, and build data marts that extract data relevant to research projects. These extracts are then made available to researchers with Data Scientist credentials to perform analyses using Cosmos-supported data science tools to address research questions\ [@epic_setup_guide].

Anyone with Cosmos Basic Access is eligible to request the training be assigned to their account. This training can be pursued either in addition to the Data Science track, or as an alternative to it.
