## Overview

UK Biobank provides an ongoing clinical study biobank offering the most comprehensive dataset of biological, health, and lifestyle information from half a million participants since initial recruitment in 2006\ [@who_we_are; @about_us]. Participants were recruited from 22 centers in Scotland, England, and Wales, with over 86% living in urban areas. Since recruitment from 2006 to 2010, these participants have consistently provided data on health records, physical measurements, lifestyle and environment, questionnaires, and biospecimens\ [@about_us; @our_participants].

The UK Biobank continually enhances its research value by integrating biomedical data with external sources, collecting additional data points, and generating new data from biospecimens. They have introduced new research initiatives, including lifestyle questionnaires, wearable technology, and one of the world's largest sleep surveys and whole-body imaging projects\ [@largest_imaging; @largest_sleep; @future_projects].

Participants were aged between 40 and 69 years and living in the UK when they joined the study between 2006 and 2010, with half being female. They represent various socioeconomic backgrounds, with more than 40,000 born outside the UK. Participants tend to be wealthier and healthier than the national average, reflecting a common 'healthy volunteer bias'\ [@who_we_are; @our_participants; @for_participant]. Despite this, the sufficient number of participants across various risk levels allows the findings to be broadly generalizable to the UK. 94.6% of participants are of white ethnicity, reflecting the national population at the time of recruitment (94.5% in the 2001 UK Census and 91.3% in 2011). Consequently, the data does not effectively represent disease risk across different ethnic groups\ [@our_participants].

The types of data collected include\ [@types_of_data]:

::: {style="margin-left: 2rem"}
- **Demographic, Lifestyle, and Self-Reported Health Data:** Basic demographics and socioeconomic status; family characteristics like illnesses of parents and siblings; lifestyle habits such as physical activity and diet; sociodemographic factors like education and employment; and various medical conditions including eyesight and mental health\ [@data_demographics].

- **Imaging:** Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans of the brain, heart, and abdomen, full-body bone density scans (DXA/DEXA) scans, carotid ultrasound images, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) scans, and COVID-19 repeat scans\ [@data_imaging].

- **Biomarker:** 251 metabolic biomarkers, 3,000 proteins using OLINK's proteomic assays, infectious disease antigens, 34 components in blood and urine, and blood counts including examples such as basophils, eosinophils, neutrophils, red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and haemoglobin\ [@data_biomarker].

- **Genetic:** Around 850,000 genetic variants directly measured, more than 90 million variants predicted using statistical methods, whole exomes and genomes, and telomere length\ [@data_genetic].

- **Health Records:** Coded hospital data for diagnoses and procedures, coded general practitioner (GP) data containing codes about diagnoses, prescriptions, and referrals (excluding confidential notes or letters), cancer diagnoses from national cancer registries, deaths data, and algorithmically classified outcomes based on qualifying diagnostic and/or procedural codes for conditions such as asthma, COPD, dementia, myocardial infarction, and stroke\ [@data_health_records].

- **Physical Measurements:** Collected during the first "baseline" visit: participants’ height, weight, waist and hip circumference, lung capacity, body composition (muscle and fat mass), hand grip strength, heel bone density, blood pressure, arterial stiffness, vision, hearing, touchscreen tests for memory, fitness level and activity monitored for one week, and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)\ [@data_physical_measures].

- **Questionnaire Results:** Some participants completed detailed questionnaires covering topics such as diet (e.g., food preferences and a 24-hour food recall), cognitive function, occupational history, mental health, digestive health, pain, and overall health and wellbeing\ [@data_questionnaire].

- **Environmental Data:** Air pollution near participants' residences, noise pollution, greenspace in participants' local areas, the nearby built environment and traffic intensity, the distance of their homes to the coast, and tap water minerals\ [@data_environment].

# Sharing Code and Using Git and GitHub

Researchers are not obligated, but may choose to share their code, example notebooks, or tools to be freely utilized by other researchers.

The UK Biobank offers supporting materials to assist researchers in appropriately using Git and GitHub with sensitive data. Recently, they released the ["Code Repository"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsZ_Fi8P2-s) course in AMS, which includes a multiple-choice test. Additionally, they have articles provide guidance on using Git and GitHub with their data, including links to instructional content and online courses about managing code-based projects. These resources are available on the [Using Code Repositories](https://community.ukbiobank.ac.uk/hc/en-gb/sections/31205109578013-Using-Code-Repositories) page\ [@code_repo_guides; @youtube_code].

Researchers are also encouraged to review the UK Biobank GitHub for code support, including tools like the [UKB-Git-Audit-Tool](https://github.com/UK-Biobank/UKB-Git-Audit-Tool), which scans the project's Git commit history for any potentially confidential information\ [@github].

The DSDE team organizes freely accessible workshops featuring real-world, hands-on examples that participants are encouraged to explore or attend. Some of our workshops, including ["Getting Started with Git and GitHub,"](https://ysph-dsde.github.io/Book-of-Workshops/Git-and-GitHub/) are being adapted for asynchronous learning on our Book of Workshops webpage\ [@book_workshops_git]. You can find information on upcoming workshops on our [events](https://ysph.yale.edu/research/research-centers-and-initiatives/public-health-data-science-and-data-equity/events/) page, and past workshop materials are available on the [Book of Workshops](https://ysph-dsde.github.io/Book-of-Workshops/).
:::


**Summary of Publication Expectations**\ [@researcher_responsibilities; @submitting_pubs]

::: {style="margin-left: 2rem"}
i. Researchers are expected to publish a commensurate level of findings within the first 3 years of receiving approval for their research project. If this is not possible, the Applicant PI must provide a reasonable explanation, such as in the annual project report, detailing why this is not feasible and providing an estimation of when the findings can be published.

ii. Researchers are expected to publish their findings in an academic journal or via an open-source publication site as soon as possible after the project's completion, and no later than 6 months afterward.

iii. UK Biobank supports publishing summary data tables, scans, and images alongside main articles but notes that these should not include any Participant Level Data or features that might be identifiable, such as reconstructions of the head and skull.

You are encouraged to contact UK Biobank regarding any concerns about using summary data tables, scans, and images at access@ukbiobank.ac.uk prior to submitting the publication.

iv. UK Biobank does not require the PI to obtain approval before publishing. However, the Applicant PI must provide a copy of any report on their project's findings and/or any press release to UK Biobank at least 2 weeks before the first public presentation or publication (e.g., meeting abstract, online report, pre-print server, and journal).

This notification can be fulfilled by [submitting a request](https://community.ukbiobank.ac.uk/hc/en-gb/requests/new) or submitting the materials through the AMS.

v. For press releases, especially those likely to provoke controversy or attract significant public attention, the Applicant PI must follow the [Communications guidelines](https://community.ukbiobank.ac.uk/hc/en-gb/articles/24818044276765-Communications-guidelines) and share a copy of the release with the UK Biobank communications team at communications@ukbiobank.ac.uk\ [@communication_guidelines].

vi. To use UK Biobank scans or images in a publication, you will need to [submit a request](https://community.ukbiobank.ac.uk/hc/en-gb/requests/new) with the image and Project ID. Any approved images should include the following acknowledgment:

vii. You must acknowledge any data linked to in your analysis. For example:

> "this work uses data provided by patients and collected by the NHS as part of their care and support."

:::


#### Requesting Downloading Data

In the past, researchers had to download requested data and agree to delete it upon completing their study. With the introduction of the UK Biobank RAP, researchers are now encouraged to access all data for their research directly on the platform. However, there may be extenuating circumstances that the UKB-RAP cannot accommodate. For example, researchers might:

::: {style="margin-left: 2rem"}
- Require tools or specialized software not yet integrated with the UKB-RAP
- Face prohibitive costs for specific cloud-based analyses
- Require substantial compute power (GPUs) that exceeds the current capacity of the UKB-RAP
:::


To ensure accessibility for health-related research, the UK Biobank AC will assess applications to download certain types of data. You can find the full exemption policy here: [UK Biobank exemptions from the UKB-RAP by default policy](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/use-our-data/research-analysis-platform/uk-biobank-exemptions-from-the-ukb-rap-by-default-policy/)\ [@download_exemptions]. If approved, researchers will then be allowed to temporarily download the data.

::: {.callout-important}
All projects with approval to temporarily download data will be subject to Tier 3 fees\ [@fees].
:::

::: {.callout-note}
Certain large datasets, including the Whole Genome Sequence data and the Whole Exome Sequence data, will only be available through the RAP. Researchers are expected not to attempt to circumvent the requirement to access these datasets solely via the RAP. For example, researchers must not make minor modifications (such as adding a ‘0’ to the data content) and then treat the data as derived to qualify for download.
:::

For more information about UK Biobank's policies and common FAQs on downloading data, please refer to the [Downloading data](https://community.ukbiobank.ac.uk/hc/en-gb/sections/19968411606301-Downloading-data) page\ [@downloading_data].


#### Financial Support\ [@financial_support]

UK Biobank offers reduced access fees for researchers from Low and Low-Middle Income Countries and for postgraduate students. With the reduced fee, you will be able to access all datasets through the RAP but will not have permission to request waivers to download any data\ [@fees].

For students seeking reduced fees, you will need to meet the following criteria:

::: {style="margin-left: 2rem"}
i) The application must be submitted by a student or their supervisor exclusively for the purpose of completing a postgraduate student project (e.g., MSc, PhD, or equivalent). The student must be the lead author of any resulting publications.

ii) The application is not allowed to be used for other research purposes, nor can it be utilized for multiple student (or other) projects.

iii) Collaborators must have a specific and relevant role in the student’s research project and may only be included at the discretion of UK Biobank.
:::

You can learn more about applying for [Financial Support](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/use-our-data/fees/financial-support/) on the UK Biobank page dedicated to this topic.
