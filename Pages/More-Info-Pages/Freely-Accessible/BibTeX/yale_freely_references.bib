https://wisspar.com), is a centralized, online platform housing data on immunogenicity from clinical trials of pneumococcal vaccines. The data on {WISSPAR} are primarily curated from outcomes tables from clinical trials and are made available in a searchable format that can be readily used for downstream analyses. The {WISSPAR} database includes trials covering numerous vaccine products, manufacturers, dosing schedules, age groups, immunocompromised groups, and geographic regions. Customizable data visualization tools are embedded within the site, or the data can be exported for further analyses. Users can also browse summary information about the clinical trials and their results. {WISSPAR} provides a platform for analysts and policy makers to efficiently gather, compare, and collate clinical trial data about pneumococcal vaccines.},
