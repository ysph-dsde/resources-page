It aims to gather longitudinal data from participants with diverse backgrounds, including age, ethnicity, lifestyle, and geographic location, to create effective individualized treatments for these groups. Participation is available at no cost to anyone living in the U.S.\\ [@overview; @participants; @intro_video]\n\nCurrently, around 600,000 participants have agreed to share their electronic health records (EHR), completed the first three surveys, provided physical measurements, and donated at least one biospecimen for biobank storage. This effort has resulted in researchers gaining access to over 473,000 electronic health records and 611,000 biospecimens\\ [@snapshot].\n\nThe types of data collected include\\ [@data_sources; @data_browser]:\n\n::: {style=\"margin-left: 2rem\"}\n- **Electronic Health Records:** The data is standardized following Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM) standards and is then compiled into eleven tables. These tables include information on basic demographics, visit details, conditions, device usage, labs, and procedures carried out by healthcare providers\\ [@summary_methods].\n\n- **Biosamples And Bioassays (Genomics):** Additional samples of blood, saliva, and/or urine are contributed by some participants for genomic sequencing assays.\n\n- **Surveys:** Each participant fills out core surveys that include questions about basic demographics, socioeconomic information, tobacco, alcohol, and recreational drug use, as well as overall health and daily activities. Participants can also choose to participate in five additional surveys on behavioral health, healthcare access, and family history\\ [@survey_explorer].\n\n- **Physical Measurements:** There are three sources for physical measurements: electronic health records (EHRs), an in-person visit for baseline physical measurements, and self-reported height and weight.\n\n- **Wearable Devices (Digital Health):** Participants can choose to share health tracking data from wearable devices, such as Fitbit, which includes physical activity levels, heart rate, and sleep patterns.\n\n- **Partnered Research Studies:** Program partners can gather additional data and contribute it to the All of Us dataset, such as the _Exploring the Mind_ study done in partnership with the National Institute of Mental Health.\n:::\n\n\n## Gaining Access\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n### Public Tier\n\n#### Do I Qualify?\n\nAll individuals seeking access can download aggregated and deidentified data\\ [@access_tiers]. Any research using All of Us data must aim to positively impact public health and wellbeing while adhering to stringent ethical standards. The research must not cause harm, discrimination, mistreatment, or marginalization of any social groups, thus supporting inclusivity and societal benefit.\n\n#### Typical Timeline\n\nIt typically takes one to two weeks to process applications, though it may take longer during busy periods such as grant submission months.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Guide\n\nNo specific steps are required to access the publicly available data, which can be found on the [Data Snapshot](https://www.researchallofus.org/data-tools/data-snapshots/) and [Data Browser](https://databrowser.researchallofus.org/?_gl=1*137ufbe*_ga*OTMwMDkxNjY5LjE3MzMxNTE0MTY.*_ga_MQVR5DG2C4*czE3NTk4NjMwMjUkbzUkZzEkdDE3NTk4NjMxNDckajUyJGwwJGgxMTk5Nzc2MzM0) webpages\\ [@data_browser; @snapshot].\n\n\n\n### Registered Tier\n\n#### Do I Qualify?\n\nWith the Registered Tier dataset, you can access individual-level data from electronic health records (EHRs), wearables, surveys, and physical measurements through the All of Us Researcher Workbench. Researchers affiliated with institutions that have signed the All of Us Data Use and Registration Agreement (DURA) can register for access for free\\ [@access_tiers].\n\nAny research using All of Us data must aim to positively impact public health and wellbeing while adhering to stringent ethical standards. The research must not cause harm, discrimination, mistreatment, or marginalization of any social groups, thus supporting inclusivity and societal benefit.\n\nCheck the [Registered Institutions](https://www.researchallofus.org/institutional-agreements/) page to see if your institution is listed and which access level you can attain. If your institution is not listed, you can submit a request form linked on the same page\\ [@aou_registered].\n\n\n#### Typical Timeline\n\nIf your institution has an active DURA with All of Us at the preferred tier of access and you do not need an individual agreement, you can proceed with registering for a Workbench account and completing the training required for Registered Tier data access, which typically takes no more than a day. You will also need to set up 2-Step verification and verify your identity, with the time to complete these steps varying by researcher.\n\nThe following timeline <a href=\"https://support.researchallofus.org/hc/en-us/articles/9707434641044-DURA-Infographic\">infographic</a> shows what to expect from a DURA application if your institution is not already registered.
