It collects and disseminates data to provide a comprehensive understanding of health and healthcare in the United States. NCHS gathers information from various sources, including birth and death records, medical records, interviews, physical examinations, and laboratory testing\\ [@main_page; @about; @data_tools].\n\nPolicymakers and public health professionals use NCHS data to identify health problems and develop policies and programs. The data is shared through reports, dashboards, and data files, measuring the health of the U.S. population, monitoring health trends, identifying disparities, documenting healthcare access and usage, supporting research, and guiding public policies and programs\\ [@about].\n\n\n\n## Gaining Access\n\nThe program manages six crucial datasets for public health, each with its own information page detailing the programs and data offerings\\ [@main_page; @data_tools]. You can find more about how to gain access to these program data on their respective pages from the [Dataset](../../../datasets/index.html) main page. They are:\n\n::: {style=\"margin-left: 2rem\"}\n- **Family Growth Survey:** Provides data on family life, marriage and divorce, pregnancy, infertility, use of contraception, and men's and women's health.\n\n- **Health Care Surveys:** Collects information on the usage and quality of health care services, including hospital visits, outpatient and emergency department visits, and long-term care.\n\n- **Rapid Surveys:** Gathers timely data on emerging public health issues, allowing for rapid response and policy adjustments.\n\n- **Health and Nutrition Examination Survey:** Combines interviews and physical examinations to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States.\n\n- **Health Interview Survey:** Collects data on a broad range of health topics through personal interviews, providing insights into health status, health care access, and progress toward national health objectives.\n\n- **Vital Statistics:** Includes data on births, deaths, marriages, and divorces, providing essential information for understanding population health trends and outcomes.\n:::\n\n## Valuable Links\n\n::: {style=\"margin-left: 2rem\"}\n- [National Center for Health Statistics](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/index.html): Find a comprehensive listing of all the data offerings provided by NCHS\\ [@main_page].\n:::\n\n\n## Publications\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThis section presents a selection of PubMed articles that utilize the dataset and are authored by individuals affiliated with the Yale School of Public Health.
