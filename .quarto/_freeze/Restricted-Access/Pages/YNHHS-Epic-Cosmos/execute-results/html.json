This affords researchers access to:\n\n- [Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)](https://medicine.yale.edu/ybic/computational-resources/ynhhs/#virtual-desktop-infrastructure): remotly access to a YNHHS secure device without requiring the YNHHS VPN. Includes software like VDI includes SQL Server Management Studio, R, Stata, SAS, Office365, and Epic and can be used to handle small-to-medium sized data, accessing Epic charts, Slicer-Dicer, and the CHP.\n- Epic SlicerDicer\n- Computational Health Platform (CHP)\n- asd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Function </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Formula </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Break </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Link </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> `read_delim()` </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> $\\leftarrow$ </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> this continues on a&lt;br&gt;new line </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> [Google](www.google.com) </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n```{=latex}\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\\hline\nAge & Frequency \\\\ \\hline\n18--25  & 15 \\\\\n26--35  & 33 \\\\\n36--45  & 22 \\\\ \\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearcher Basic Access (RBA) is a standard account enabling researchers’ access to YNHHS essential research software and applications. All YU-YNHHS faculty and licensed providers are permitted to submit and sponsor access requests. If you need access, your manager or sponsor with a YNHHS account must complete the YNHHS Researcher Basic Access request.\n\n\nThings you will need to apply:\n\n- YNHHS Researcher Basic Access** (i.e. Research VDI, Epic Research, Slicer Dicer): https://shorturl.at/nJOS0\n- HIPAA Certification - https://hipaa.yale.edu/training/training-modules\n- Human Subject Protection - https://shorturl.at/kyEQX\n- Slicer-Dicer proficiency demonstration*** - you may be contacted with details upon submitting this form.\n\n\n::: callout-important\nIf you are not a member of the YU-YNHHS Covered Entity (e.g. YSPH), you will need a sponsor from a covered component to submit on your behalf. Find the current \"List of Covered Departments\" under \"Administrative Functions\" on the [hippa.yale.edu](https://hipaa.yale.edu/resources/resource-documents-and-guidance) resources page.\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-important\nThe Epic UserWeb email you submit with this form is how both Yale and Epic will contact you with respect to this application and all other Cosmos-related information. \n\nYour email should be your yale.edu or YNHHS email and you are responsible updating this information in your Epic user account.\n:::\n\n\n## Step-by-Step\n\n1.
