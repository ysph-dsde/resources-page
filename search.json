These nanodiscs are of tunable diameter between 8-20 nm and allow for direct extraction from the endogenous membrane while maintaining that native membrane environment. Here we present that guide to native extraction in an easily searchable format with the ability to search for single proteins of interest or networks of proteins. Searching for your protein(s) of interest will yield the preferred condition for optimal native extraction for that protein of interest serving as a starting point for structural and biochemical studies."
