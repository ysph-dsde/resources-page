    "text": "Overview\nUK Biobank provides an ongoing clinical study biobank offering the most comprehensive dataset of biological, health, and lifestyle information from half a million participants since initial recruitment in 2006 1,5. Participants were recruited from 22 centers in Scotland, England, and Wales, with over 86% living in urban areas. Since recruitment from 2006 to 2010, these participants have consistently provided data on health records, physical measurements, lifestyle and environment, questionnaires, and biospecimens 1,6.\nThe UK Biobank continually enhances its research value by integrating biomedical data with external sources, collecting additional data points, and generating new data from biospecimens. They have introduced new research initiatives, including lifestyle questionnaires, wearable technology, and one of the world’s largest sleep surveys and whole-body imaging projects 2–4.\nParticipants were aged between 40 and 69 years and living in the UK when they joined the study between 2006 and 2010, with half being female. They represent various socioeconomic backgrounds, with more than 40,000 born outside the UK. Participants tend to be wealthier and healthier than the national average, reflecting a common ‘healthy volunteer bias’ 5–7. Despite this, the sufficient number of participants across various risk levels allows the findings to be broadly generalizable to the UK. 94.6% of participants are of white ethnicity, reflecting the national population at the time of recruitment (94.5% in the 2001 UK Census and 91.3% in 2011). Consequently, the data does not effectively represent disease risk across different ethnic groups 6.\nThe types of data collected include 8:\n\n\nDemographic, Lifestyle, and Self-Reported Health Data: Basic demographics and socioeconomic status; family characteristics like illnesses of parents and siblings; lifestyle habits such as physical activity and diet; sociodemographic factors like education and employment; and various medical conditions including eyesight and mental health 9.\nImaging: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans of the brain, heart, and abdomen, full-body bone density scans (DXA/DEXA) scans, carotid ultrasound images, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) scans, and COVID-19 repeat scans 10.\nBiomarker: 251 metabolic biomarkers, 3,000 proteins using OLINK’s proteomic assays, infectious disease antigens, 34 components in blood and urine, and blood counts including examples such as basophils, eosinophils, neutrophils, red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and haemoglobin 11.\nGenetic: Around 850,000 genetic variants directly measured, more than 90 million variants predicted using statistical methods, whole exomes and genomes, and telomere length 12.\nHealth Records: Coded hospital data for diagnoses and procedures, coded general practitioner (GP) data containing codes about diagnoses, prescriptions, and referrals (excluding confidential notes or letters), cancer diagnoses from national cancer registries, deaths data, and algorithmically classified outcomes based on qualifying diagnostic and/or procedural codes for conditions such as asthma, COPD, dementia, myocardial infarction, and stroke 13.\nPhysical Measurements: Collected during the first “baseline” visit: participants’ height, weight, waist and hip circumference, lung capacity, body composition (muscle and fat mass), hand grip strength, heel bone density, blood pressure, arterial stiffness, vision, hearing, touchscreen tests for memory, fitness level and activity monitored for one week, and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) 14.\nQuestionnaire Results: Some participants completed detailed questionnaires covering topics such as diet (e.g., food preferences and a 24-hour food recall), cognitive function, occupational history, mental health, digestive health, pain, and overall health and wellbeing 15.\nEnvironmental Data: Air pollution near participants’ residences, noise pollution, greenspace in participants’ local areas, the nearby built environment and traffic intensity, the distance of their homes to the coast, and tap water minerals 16."

    "section": "Gaining Access",
    "text": "Gaining Access\n\nData Resource\n\n\n\nDo I Qualify?\nUK Biobank data are made available to eligible researchers from academic, charity, government, and commercial organizations worldwide for health-related research that serves the public interest. Any research using UK Biobank data must aim to positively impact public health and wellbeing while adhering to stringent ethical standards. The research must not cause harm, discrimination, mistreatment, or marginalization of any social groups, thus supporting inclusivity and societal benefit 17.\nTo be eligible to access the data, researchers must demonstrate a proven track record of legitimate health-related research. They must also be affiliated with a recognized research organization and operate from a country that complies with international regulations and is not subject to UK, US, or EU sanctions, as outlined in the UK Biobank International Sanctions Policy 18,19. Additionally, the UK Biobank no longer accepts applications from insurance companies, as specified in the Access to UK Biobank Data section under “Controlling Access” 17.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nUK Biobank ensures compliance with these eligibility requirements by conducting thorough background checks on researchers applying for data access. This is done by trained personnel who verify the legitimacy of the applicants and their research credentials 17.\n\n\n\n\nHow Is My Application Assessed?\nThe application process will involve the UK Biobank Scientific Team and Access Committee (AC), a sub-committee of the UK Biobank Board 20,21. The scientific team will evaluate the information provided in the data request application to determine if the application meets the required access criteria 22.\nThe AC, which meets on a quarterly basis, is responsible for making key access decisions, notably those regarding the use of depletable samples, recontact, or potentially contentious research. The AC will assess the application for 22:\n\n\nThe likelihood of the proposed research receiving approval\nThe proposed research’s compliance with the required access criteria (including legal and ethical standards)\nThe availability of the requisite data and/or samples for the proposed research\nThe scientific justification for the amount of depletable sample required\nThe cost associated with providing the requested data and/or samples\n\n\nThere are four possible outcomes 21:\n\n\nThe UK Biobank Scientific Team approves the application and presents it to the Access Sub-Committee, which may raise any queries.\nThe application is sent back to the Applicant Principal Investigator (PI) for revisions.\nThe UK Biobank Scientific Team recommends the application for denial and escalates it to the Access Sub-Committee, which will review and discuss it. The Sub-Committee may approve or decline the application, providing reasons and suggestions for a successful future application if applicable.\nThe UK Biobank Scientific Team forwards the application to the Access Sub-Committee for detailed consideration and approval due to unusual, contentious, ethical-legal, or other novel issues.\n\n\nAdditional details describing how applications are evaluated, and the responsibilities involved, can be found in the Access Procedures document, available under the section “Key Documents.” Specifically, refer to Section C10, “Roles of the Parties in the Application Review Process” 19,21.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nMost of the details summarized in the remaining sections about “Gaining Access” were sourced from the Access Procedures document 19,21. If any information was supplemented or sourced from other resources, it is cited accordingly.\n\n\n\n\nTypical Timeline\n\n\n\nA summary of the application process, including information on when additional reviews may be necessary 22–24.\n\n\n\n\n  ×\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nStep-by-Step Guide\nAll researchers must register, complete training modules, and sign user agreements in the UK Biobank Access Management System (AMS) before they can request data 25. The AMS allows you to manage your portfolio information and check which outstanding trainings need to be completed to gain access.\nData is accessed via the DNAnexus UK Biobank cloud computing portal, Research Analysis Platform (UKB-RAP), provided in conjunction with Amazon Web Services (AWS). UK Biobank offers the opportunity to request data downloads, which are individually assessed and approved by the UK Biobank Access and Scientific Teams. These teams make a recommendation to the Access Committee, which then reviews the application 26. More details on this process can be found below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIt is recommended to use Google Chrome to access the AMS due to identified compatibility issues with certain browsers, such as Firefox and Safari.\n\n\na. Register for Access in the Access Management System (AMS) 27,28\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf your institution is not approved, you will not be able to complete AMS registration until it gains approval to access UK Biobank data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nSome of these answers, along with details of the research the user participates in, are made publicly available on the UK Biobank website. You can find a list of all ongoing, approved projects on their Existing Projects page 29.\n\n\n\n\nRegister for an AMS account for free using your institution’s email address.\nVerify your new account using the 24-hour verification link sent to your registration email.\nTo complete the registration process, log in to the UK Biobank AMS system using your recently verified credentials.\nYou will then see a message window that prompts you to complete your registration by providing additional details about you. The mandatory fields include:\n\n\n\nYour full name, phone number, and date of birth\nAn up-to-date resume/CV in English confirming your current position and institution, OR a link to a personal profile page on your institution’s website\nPubMed reference numbers for up to 5 peer-reviewed publications where you are listed as an author (if available)\nDetails of any complaints raised against you within the past 3 years (if applicable)\nName of the primary institution you are affiliated with that has approved access to UK Biobank data\nYour email address with this institution and used for registration\nYour position at this institution\nList other institutions with which you plan to use the UK Biobank Resource (if applicable)\n\n\n\nThe registration team will review your application and send a message within the AMS portal. They may contact you to request further details.\n\n\nb. Complete the Training Modules 25\nThe Home page of your AMS portal will display notices about mandatory training along with any announcements or important information. Outstanding training module requests can be found on the Profile page in the “Training” section. Additionally, you can find previously uploaded Medical Research Council (MRC) certificates there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou must annually complete the MRC course “Research, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) & Confidentiality” and upload the passing certificate 27. You may also be asked to recomplete the two introductory courses and their accompanying multiple-choice tests.\n\n\n\n\nComplete the MRC course “Research, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) & Confidentiality”, which consists of 10 short video. If this is your first time logging into the MRC Centre for Research Policy Learning Management System, you will need to first create and verify a new account.\nTake the MRC course 10-question multiple-choice quiz. You must pass with a score of 70% or higher for the certificate to be accepted by the Access team.\nSave a PDF copy of the passing completion certificate and upload it in the “Upload MRC Certificate” section of your AMS Profile page.\nComplete the course video “Introduction to using UK Biobank” 30.\nComplete the course video “Introduction to the UK Biobank Research Analysis Platform (RAP)” 31.\nTake the two multiple-choice tests, found in the “Training” section of your AMS Profile page. You must pass with a score of 80% or higher on both tests to complete the process.\n\n\nThe three listed courses are mandatory to gain access. Additionally, UK Biobank has recently released the “Code Repository” course, which includes its own multiple-choice test. This course is planned to become mandatory starting March 31\\(^{st}\\), 2026 32.\nc. Apply to Receive Data 17,28\nOnce registration is completed, an “Applications” page link will appear in the sidebar 22. There are two options when requesting access to data: data only or data and biospecimens. Both application types have distinct features but follow similar review processes, which are summarized below. Researchers can find specific details about the application contents in their AMS portals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nSome of these answers, along with details of the research the user participates in, are made publicly available on the UK Biobank website. You can find a list of all ongoing, approved projects on their Existing Projects page 29.\n\n\n\n\nThe applicant PI must complete and submit an application for either data only or data and biospecimens. Some of the fields in the application might include:\n\n\n\nA summary of the research you intend to conduct in the project, including the research questions, objectives, and scientific rationale (displayed publicly)\nKeywords describing the research\nConfirmations that the research will be used to perform health-related research and ultimately aims to improve public health\nThe type and size of the data requested\nConfirmation if your research requires biospecimens, and if recontacting participants is needed\nDescription of the methods\nA statement if the study will result in the generation of new data\n\n\n\nList all project collaborators along with their contact details. Additionally, you must include contact information for a signatory authorized to sign the Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) on behalf of each institution collaborators are from.\nIndicate the tier of data you are requesting, as each tier comes with different associated costs. For more information on the fees, visit the biobank’s Fee Structure page 33.\nSubmit the form for review by the UK Biobank Scientific Team and AC, which meets quarterly. Refer to the previous section titled “How Is My Application Assessed?” for more details about this process.\nApproved applications will require the execution of the MTA and payment of access charges within 90 days of receiving the notice. Only then will the data and/or samples be released to the Applicant PI 22.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nData is usually released weekly, whereas samples are distributed following a predetermined schedule 22.\n\n\n\nIf your application was rejected, you can apply for reconsideration, as detailed in Section C4.4-5 of “Application Reviewed” found in the Access Procedures document available under the section “Key Documents” 19,21.\nd. Accessing the Data\n\n\nApproved applications with a signed MTA and paid fees will have a project status of “Underway” on AMS, enabling associated researchers to access the data in the UKB-RAP 25.\nCreate a DNAnexus account and associate it with your UK Biobank AMS account: Connect Your Account to UK Biobank.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nThere is no additional charge by UK Biobank to access the RAP. However, certain activities within the RAP will incur costs payable to the platform provider, DNAnexus. These include fees for data storage (both uploaded and derived data), computing and analysis (based on instance type), and data transfer charges. To assist researchers in managing these costs, UK Biobank provides an initial £40 of credit towards these expenses upon joining UKB-RAP 33.\nIn addition to signing agreements with UK Biobank, researchers using the RAP will also need to accept certain terms and conditions to use DNAnexus. These terms can be found on their Subscription Terms of Service page 34.\n\n\n\nAll approved projects will have a minimum of 3 years to conduct their research, with the option to apply for extensions of 12 months, 2 years, or 3 years if necessary 24.\nTo maintain access for the duration of a research project, the researcher must do the following. For more details about how UK Biobank expects PIs and researchers to manage ongoing projects, refer to the Step 4: Manage your project list of articles 19,35.\n\n\n\nAll researchers must keep their information in the AMS updated and ensure their training is current 19.\nApplicant PIs and Lead Investigators at Collaborator Institutions must annually submit a project report, confirming project affiliates, compliance with the MTA, security expectations, and providing project updates along with an outline of activities planned for the next 12 months. For more details, refer to Submitting an annual report 36.\n\n\n\nResearchers are expected to promptly notify the UK Biobank when their project has been completed, regardless of the remaining time allowed to complete the project.\n\n\n\n\nReturn of Results and Publication Expectations\nThe UK Biobank has specific expectations and procedures for conducting research using their data, which include the handling of generated results, the code used to analyze the data, and any form of publication of findings. These procedures are outlined below, with some of them being critical both to maintain access to the data and to fulfill the UK Biobank data use agreements.\nResearchers are encouraged to review the Guidance on Researcher Responsibilities and Step 5: Return your results pages, as well as Section B8 “Publication of findings, summary datasets and return of results” in the Access Procedures document, available under the “Key Documents” section, to fully understand these expectations 19,21,37,38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe UK Biobank provides specific guidelines for acknowledgments in publications, reports, and press releases. These can be reviewed in the previously linked articles and on their Communications guidelines page 39. For example, you must include the following statement in the Acknowledgments section of your paper or wherever possible in reference search tools 40:\n\n“This research has been conducted using the UK Biobank Resource under Application Number xxxxx.”\n\n\n\nSummary of the Return of Results 38\nResearchers are required to return all key individual-level variables derived from bulk data, as well as any related research outputs, within 6 months following the publication of their results or 12 months after the conclusion of their project, whichever occurs first. This submission must include a comprehensive data dictionary, any well-annotated code or methods used, and the corresponding DOI.\nThis transfer can be accomplished using the RAP system to directly send the generated information to UK Biobank. For detailed guidance on what is expected when returning results, please refer to the full guide available on the Returning your results to UK Biobank webpage 38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSharing Code and Using Git and GitHub\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers are not obligated, but may choose to share their code, example notebooks, or tools to be freely utilized by other researchers.\nThe UK Biobank offers supporting materials to assist researchers in appropriately using Git and GitHub with sensitive data. Recently, they released the “Code Repository” course in AMS, which includes a multiple-choice test. Additionally, they have articles provide guidance on using Git and GitHub with their data, including links to instructional content and online courses about managing code-based projects. These resources are available on the Using Code Repositories page 32,41.\nResearchers are also encouraged to review the UK Biobank GitHub for code support, including tools like the UKB-Git-Audit-Tool, which scans the project’s Git commit history for any potentially confidential information 42.\nThe DSDE team organizes freely accessible workshops featuring real-world, hands-on examples that participants are encouraged to explore or attend. Some of our workshops, including “Getting Started with Git and GitHub,” are being adapted for asynchronous learning on our Book of Workshops webpage 43. You can find information on upcoming workshops on our events page, and past workshop materials are available on the Book of Workshops.\n\n\n\nSummary of Publication Expectations 37,40\n\n\nResearchers are expected to publish a commensurate level of findings within the first 3 years of receiving approval for their research project. If this is not possible, the Applicant PI must provide a reasonable explanation, such as in the annual project report, detailing why this is not feasible and providing an estimation of when the findings can be published.\nResearchers are expected to publish their findings in an academic journal or via an open-source publication site as soon as possible after the project’s completion, and no later than 6 months afterward.\nUK Biobank supports publishing summary data tables, scans, and images alongside main articles but notes that these should not include any Participant Level Data or features that might be identifiable, such as reconstructions of the head and skull.\n\nYou are encouraged to contact UK Biobank regarding any concerns about using summary data tables, scans, and images at access@ukbiobank.ac.uk prior to submitting the publication.\n\nUK Biobank does not require the PI to obtain approval before publishing. However, the Applicant PI must provide a copy of any report on their project’s findings and/or any press release to UK Biobank at least 2 weeks before the first public presentation or publication (e.g., meeting abstract, online report, pre-print server, and journal).\n\nThis notification can be fulfilled by submitting a request or submitting the materials through the AMS.\n\nFor press releases, especially those likely to provoke controversy or attract significant public attention, the Applicant PI must follow the Communications guidelines and share a copy of the release with the UK Biobank communications team at communications@ukbiobank.ac.uk 39.\n\n\nTo use UK Biobank scans or images in a publication, you will need to submit a request with the image and Project ID. Any approved images should include the following acknowledgment:\n\n\nReproduced by kind permission of UK Biobank ©\n\n\nYou must acknowledge any data linked to in your analysis. For example:\n\n\n“this work uses data provided by patients and collected by the NHS as part of their care and support.”\n\n\n\n\nRequesting Downloading Data\nIn the past, researchers had to download requested data and agree to delete it upon completing their study. With the introduction of the UK Biobank RAP, researchers are now encouraged to access all data for their research directly on the platform. However, there may be extenuating circumstances that the UKB-RAP cannot accommodate. For example, researchers might:\n\n\nRequire tools or specialized software not yet integrated with the UKB-RAP\nFace prohibitive costs for specific cloud-based analyses\nRequire substantial compute power (GPUs) that exceeds the current capacity of the UKB-RAP\n\n\nTo ensure accessibility for health-related research, the UK Biobank AC will assess applications to download certain types of data. You can find the full exemption policy here: UK Biobank exemptions from the UKB-RAP by default policy 26. If approved, researchers will then be allowed to temporarily download the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAll projects with approval to temporarily download data will be subject to Tier 3 fees 33.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nCertain large datasets, including the Whole Genome Sequence data and the Whole Exome Sequence data, will only be available through the RAP. Researchers are expected not to attempt to circumvent the requirement to access these datasets solely via the RAP. For example, researchers must not make minor modifications (such as adding a ‘0’ to the data content) and then treat the data as derived to qualify for download.\n\n\nFor more information about UK Biobank’s policies and common FAQs on downloading data, please refer to the Downloading data page 44.\n\n\nFinancial Support 45\nUK Biobank offers reduced access fees for researchers from Low and Low-Middle Income Countries and for postgraduate students. With the reduced fee, you will be able to access all datasets through the RAP but will not have permission to request waivers to download any data 33.\nFor students seeking reduced fees, you will need to meet the following criteria:\n\n\nThe application must be submitted by a student or their supervisor exclusively for the purpose of completing a postgraduate student project (e.g., MSc, PhD, or equivalent). The student must be the lead author of any resulting publications.\nThe application is not allowed to be used for other research purposes, nor can it be utilized for multiple student (or other) projects.\nCollaborators must have a specific and relevant role in the student’s research project and may only be included at the discretion of UK Biobank.\n\n\nYou can learn more about applying for Financial Support on the UK Biobank page dedicated to this topic."

    "text": "Overview\nCosmos is a comprehensive dataset that compiles records voluntarily contributed by health systems using Epic for electronic medical record (EMR) management. More than just a data repository, Cosmos provides a complete data warehouse and analytical infrastructure, including tools such as SlicerDicer and the Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM), designed to facilitate scientific discoveries and advance medicine 1,2.\nThe network currently encompasses nearly 2,000 hospitals across the country and globally, with almost half a million physicians caring for approximately 300 million patients. This collaboration creates a dataset containing billions of high-quality, representative, longitudinal clinical data points 3. Notably, the patient demographics represented in Cosmos closely align with those of the United States Census, enhancing its research utility 4. All participating organizations and members of the Cosmos Governing Council can be viewed on the Cosmos Community page 3.\nEpic Cosmos combines inpatient and outpatient charts into unified, longitudinal patient records while removing duplicates that may arise from patients receiving care at multiple Cosmos organizations. The data provided to researchers adheres to HIPAA-defined limited data set standards 4. To enhance patient privacy protections, the de-identified dataset suppresses geographic information, consistently shifts patient dates, and conceals source organizations. Detailed information on individual data element transformation processes is available in the Cosmos Data Domain Encyclopedia and the Data Dictionary (also accessible through the Cosmos portal) 5,6.\nThe Cosmos Overview page provides an invaluable introduction to Epic’s resource, outlining essential information for both non-sponsored and third-party sponsored research projects 4. This includes guidance on Cosmos data usage, project tracking procedures, and publication expectations, with additional details available in the corresponding data access level sections on this webpage.\nThe types of data collected in the EMR are continuously expanding. For example, researchers currently have access to the following data 4:\n\n\nPatient Information: Limited demographic details such as age, sex, gender identity, race, ethnicity, location, patient status, and family history, social history elements like tobacco and substance use, birth control, social determinants of health, allergy information, and detailed birth history.\nVisits and Encounters: Patient encounters and admissions including encounter type, classification, department and provider specialties, and visit reasons, as well as clinical notes from various medical documentation and patient experience data from MyChart usage and patient-reported outcomes.\nMedical Data: Diagnoses, clinical and billed procedures, and vital signs such as blood pressure, pulse, temperature, respiratory rate, SpO2 levels, height, weight, BMI, and head circumference.\nLab and Genomics: Lab results such as component-specific results, susceptibility results, and reference ranges, in addition to genomic variant data like allelic state and chromosome details, and biosamples for genomic assays including blood, saliva, and urine samples.\nHealth Assessments: Information on cancer staging, immunizations, and eye exams, with details on stage group, immunization type, and visual acuity.\nSpecialty Data: Records data on hospital-acquired infections and various infection types, surgical procedures, transplant data for liver and kidney transplants, and health tracking data from wearable devices.\nResearch and Analytics: Geographic factors like RUCA and Social Vulnerability Index, risk scores for conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and data from research studies detailing study type, enrollment, and partnered research contributions.\nMiscellaneous: Encompasses peer group information on various types of hospitals, medication data including prescriptions and patient-reported medications, and additional lab results."

    "text": "Gaining Access\n\nCosmos Basic Access\n\n\n\nDo I Qualify?\nBasic access provides users with entry to the Cosmos data portal, allowing them to query the limited dataset using SlicerDicer, create dashboards with custom elements, and share dashboards with other Cosmos users 7.\nWhile Yale University-Yale New Haven Hospital System (YU-YNHHS) manages access to YNHHS Epic data through Research Basic Access (RBA), Epic coordinates with YU-YNHHS to manage researcher access to Epic Cosmos data. According to their rules, any researcher seeking access to Epic Cosmos must already have RBA to the YNHHS Epic data. Full instructions for obtaining RBA are available on our Yale New Haven Health System (YNHHS) Epic information webpage 8.\nResearchers in the “Your Community” category (directly affiliated partners) may require additional review by the Cosmos Governing Council to gain access to Epic Cosmos. External Collaborators (e.g., pharma employees, contractors, etc.) are typically not intended to have access to Epic Cosmos, but special approval requests can be submitted to the Cosmos Governing Council. These qualification tiers are illustrated in Epic’s infographic below 8.\n\n\n\nEpic Cosmos user request process and requirements infographic from “Granting Cosmos Portal Access to Users” by Epic, last approved by the Cosmos Governing Council on April 20th, 2023 8.\n\n\n\n\n  ×\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nTypical Timeline\nCITI training completion typically takes 1-2 weeks, as the training is comprehensive and involved. Once completed, certificates take no more than 2 business days to be reflected in Workday. Note that recognition timing may vary if training is completed outside of Workday 9.\n\n\nStep-by-Step Guide\nThis page assumes researchers have RBA. Follow the YNHHS Epic webpage instructions to obtain RBA if needed.\na: Complete Yale’s HIPAA Training\n\nFor Yale NetID holders: Complete the HIPAA Privacy and Security courses in Workday, including the basic privacy and security module, followed by the role-specific module (e.g., for clinicians or researchers) 10.\nFor Non-Yale NetID holders: Read and sign the HIPAA Privacy and Security training materials specific to your role on the project (e.g., for clinicians or researchers). Submission directions for these documents can be found on the accompanying PDF 10.\n\nb: Obtain a Human Subjects Protection Training (HSPT) Certificate from CITI\nA Human Subjects Protection Training (HSPT) certificate from CITI completed within the last three years is required. Below is a summary of the process, and the complete directions can be found on the It’s Your Yale page about HSPT 9.\nResearchers need to complete the following CITI certificates:\n\n\n“Basic Training”\nOne of the following two initial/basic Human Subjects Research modules: “Biomedical Research Basic” or “Social Behavioral Educational Researchers Basic”.\n\n\nIf CITI certification was completed at another institution, a copy should be emailed to irb.training@yale.edu before proceeding to Section C. For further inquiries, the same email address can be used.\nIf you have not yet received an HSPT certificate or if your certificate is more than three years old, you will need to complete the training in CITI. First, access CITI or link your CITI account with your Yale Workday account.\nb.i: Accessing CITI and Linking It\n\nFor Yale Employees: It is preferable, though not required, to access the CITI training modules through Workday. This will expedite the recognition of the certificate in the Yale Integrated Research Enterprise Solution (IRES) IRB system.\n\n\nOpen the Learning Homepage in Workday.\nThe CITI training link will appear as the “Human Subjects Protection Training – Initial/Refresher” course under the “Required Training” section. If it does not appear, ensure that your name is listed in the IRES IRB pending study or submission. If it still does not appear, contact your manager or reach out to learning@yale.edu or irb.training@yale.edu to request a manual assignment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf available, complete the “Compliance Assessment” to indicate that you are conducting human subjects research.\n\n\n\nOnce the “Human Subjects Protection Training – Initial/Refresher” course page is accessed, the “Enroll” button should be clicked to proceed.\nA button labeled “Start Program”, or “Retake Program” if being taken as a refresher, will appear under the course photo. Click it to proceed.\nLog into CITI using the “Yale University Training Opportunities” Single Sign-On (SSO).\n\n\nFor Non-Yale Employees: Non-Yale employees should access CITI through their own institution or directly via the main webpage. Pursuing certification independently may incur charges. Current costs for CITI courses can be found on the Explore Our Courses webpage 11.\n\nb.ii: Register for the Certification\nOnce access to CITI courses is granted, follow these steps to complete the certification:\n\n\nIn CITI, select “Add a Course” and scroll to the bottom to find the initial/basic CITI HSP Training under the Human Subjects Research heading.\nIndicate the intent to take a Human Subjects Research course and select either “Biomedical Research” or “Social Behavioral Educational Researchers.” When prompted, confirm the selection of the “Biomedical Research-Basic Course.”\nComplete the course modules and achieve a passing grade of at least 70% on the assessment.\nIf the Workday account was not linked with CITI, save the completion certificate and send it to irb.training@yale.edu. If accessed through Workday, the record should auto-update.\n\n\nc: Mastering SlicerDicer in the Cosmos Environment\nIndividuals are expected to have completed the YNHHS Epic RBA application process, including all mandatory training for that level of access. YNHH and Joint Data Analytics Team (JDAT) provide training specifically tailored for the YNHHS Epic portal within the YNHH Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI), which differs from the training provided by Epic for similar analytic tools available in the Cosmos data portal, such as SlicerDicer 7,12.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlicerDicer Proficiency Assessment\n\n\n\nApplicants may be required to demonstrate their proficiency with SlicerDicer upon request.\n\n\nTo help users get acclimated to these differences, the following resources are recommended by Epic:\n\n\n“Cosmos Portal & Analytics Resources” - available on Galaxy 13\nHere’s How… SlicerDicer [POSS043] - available on weLearning 14\nArchived Past Slice of the Month Sessions showcasing researchers using Cosmos in various ways for their own research projects 15.\n\n\nd: Submit Access Application\nThe preceding steps help applicants prepare for filling out the Cosmos Basic Access Request form 16. Once these steps have been completed, fill out the YNHH Cosmos Basic Access Request form, following applicable guidelines, to initiate the approval process 2.\ne: Training\nComplete training requirements, role descriptions, and expectations can be found in the Cosmos Training and Support section of the Cosmos Setup and Support Guide, with key points summarized below 7,12. Optional training modules for Data Science and Data Architecture certifications are also available through the same section.\ne.i: Required Training\n\n\nUser Agreement - available on Galaxy 17\n“Explore SlicerDicer” - available on Cosmos. From the main Cosmos landing page, hover over the “Explore” tab in the top bar to display the drop-down menu, and select “Explore SlicerDicer” under the “Explore” section 18.\n\n\ne.ii: Recommended Training\n\n\nResponsible Use Document and Assessment - available on Galaxy 19\nCosmos Learning Home - available on Cosmos 20\nCosmos eLearning Videos - available on weLearning 21\n“Cosmos Publication Checklist” - available on Galaxy with summarized notes below 22\nSelect materials from the Cosmos Super User Badge training - available on Epic University 23. Under the “Super User in the Portal” section, access:\n\n\n\nSelf-Study materials\nProject\n\n\n\nSelect materials from the Cosmos Researcher User Badge training - available on Epic University 24. Under the “Data Literacy for Cosmos Researcher” section access the “Self-Study” materials.\n\n\n\n\nAccessing Epic Cosmos\nAccess to the Epic Cosmos SlicerDicer is through the Epic Cosmos portal, not the YNHH VDI. You can open this portal from the Epic UserWeb by navigating to the “Show All” drop-down menu and selecting “Cosmos” under the “Support” section.\nIf you encounter any issues logging into Cosmos, please contact JDAT for assistance. If the issue persists, reach out to CosmosUserRequests@Epic.com.\n\n\nInitiating Collaborative Projects\nResearchers with Cosmos Basic Access can share code and datasets with peers who are collaborators on specific research questions 25. These collaboration networks are created using the Cosmos Projects tool. Directions on how to create and maintain projects can be found in the “Cosmos Tip Sheet: Create and Monitor Projects” 26.\nCertified Cosmos Data Science users can share code with the entire Cosmos community via Cosmos’s GitLab. For more details, please refer to the Data Science certificate tab below.\n\n\nPublications Expectations\nEpic provides data users with a checklist for preparing data for publications, emphasized in the user agreement, “Cosmos Rules of the Road”. The full instructions and expectations can be found in the Galaxy “Cosmos Publication Checklist” article and the “Cosmos Rules of the Road”, which outlines some of the Data Use Agreement terms 22,27.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Privacy: Low Count Suppression\n\n\n\nWhen transferring results off the VDI or sharing SlicerDicer graphs, it is imperative to follow Epic’s process to prevent the exportation of line-level data. No counts less than 10 can be individually noted (report as &lt;11).\nReview the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Cell Size Suppression Policy outlined by the Research Data Assistance Center (ResDAC) for examples of how to appropriately suppress low counts 28.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReporting Citations of Your Findings\n\n\n\nResearchers are obligated to provide a list of citations for any publications or references to their research conducted using Cosmos. This list must be submitted to the Governing Council on a semi-annual basis 27."

    "text": "Overview\nThe Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) is supported by the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) Surveillance Research Program (SRP), which provides national leadership in cancer surveillance science and offers the tools and expertise necessary for collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and disseminating reliable population-based statistics. Since 1973, SEER has provided vital cancer statistics, growing to cover 45.9% of the US population across 22 geographic areas with its data on cancer incidence and survival. To date, they have recorded as many as approximately 17 million cases in some of their registries, almost 16 million of which represent malignant cases 1,2.\nSEER data includes patient demographics, tumor characteristics, initial treatments, and survival outcomes, offering significant representation of various racial and ethnic groups across the nation 2,7. The data is collected from participating cancer registries, which can be either population-based or hospital-based, with special registries focusing on specific cancers 8.\nThe types of data products available include 3,7,9,10:\n\n\nSEER Research Data: The standard SEER data, which provides information on cancer incidence and survival from population-based cancer registries. The data encompasses patient demographics, primary tumor site, tumor morphology, stage at diagnosis, extent and history of the disease, initial treatments, and survival outcomes.\nSEER Research Plus and NCCR Data: This expanded category includes all the SEER Research Data as well as additional variables and detailed information not included in the standard dataset, such as geography, month in addition to year of diagnosis, and other demographic fields.

    "title": "NCHS’s National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)",
    "section": "Overview",
    "text": "Overview\nThe National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is a nationwide program that collects and analyzes data on a wide range of health topics. It holds the distinction of being the nation’s oldest and longest continuously running health survey, dating back to 1957 following the signing of the National Health Survey Act by President Eisenhower in 1956. NHIS gathers accurate and up-to-date statistical information on illness, disability, and healthcare utilization in the United States, providing nationally representative data on health trends among the civilian noninstitutionalized population across diverse demographic and socioeconomic characteristics 1,2.\nNHIS is conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), with interviews administered by trained U.S. Census Bureau field staff. The survey uses a stratified probability design that continuously samples the civilian noninstitutionalized U.S. population through weekly household interviews, oversampling underrepresented groups to ensure nationally representative results 3. The survey is cross-sectional, collecting data from different individuals in one-year cycles rather than following participants over time. In 1985, NHIS transitioned from using the Current Population Survey sampling frame to an independent approach, with routine census updates that improve sampling efficiency 4. While the previous design was multistage, the current design no longer employs this method 2,5.\nEach year, approximately 27,000 adults and 9,000 children participate in confidential, face-to-face interviews. While questionnaires are constructed for continuity, survey content is updated every 15–20 years to reflect methodological advances and evolving health topics, with annual question changes addressing current needs 2,6. NCHS regularly adds questions on emerging topics, such as opioid use and pain management (2019) or concussions (2020-2021). To provide more robust datasets for analyzing complex relationships, NHIS data has been linked with data from other sources, with these linked datasets available in the RDC 7,8.\nResearchers combining cross-sectional iterations for longitudinal analysis should review recommendations in the NHIS Questionnaires, Datasets, and Documentation and monitor questionnaire redesign notices like the 2019 NHIS Questionnaire Redesign 3,8,9.\nThe types of data collected include 5,7,8:\n\n\nDemographic Data: Basic demographics such as age, gender, race, socioeconomic status, family characteristics, and geographic location information such as state and urbanicity.\nDisability and Health Limitations: Measures of restricted-activity days, bed-disability days, work- and school-loss days, bed days over the last 12 months, and long-term limitations from chronic diseases or impairments.\nHealthcare Utilization: Information on physician visits (during a 2-week period, interval since the last visit, and number of visits in the last 12 months), short-stay hospitalizations (number of episodes and days per stay), health insurance coverage, dental health, and medical device implants for all family members.\nChronic and Acute Conditions: Data on conditions responsible for disability days and physician visits, diabetes (initial and follow-up screenings and risk factors), orofacial pain, digestive disorders, and selected chronic conditions. Additionally, cancer risk factors are assessed through both control and epidemiology samples, and information on poliomyelitis is gathered.\nOccupational and Lifestyle Data: Longest job worked, measures of occupational health, and information on smoking and alcohol use for adults 18 years and over.\nFamily and Individual Health Data: Child health data for one child per family under 18 years, and information on child adoption for female family members 20-54 years old.\nRotating Core Questions: Regularly scheduled but not annual questions on topics including mental health (psychological distress), use of health services (preventive services), health-related behaviors (physical activity and sleep), injuries and chronic pain, and allergies.\nSponsored Content: Funded by other federal agencies, this includes questions on access to and ability to afford food (food security), cancer screening, complementary and alternative medicine, heart disease and stroke prevention. These questions may be included annually or less frequently, and may vary from year to year. For example, proposed schedule of rotating sponsored questions about cancer is available on the National Cancer Institute’s NHIS Cancer Control Supplement (CCS) website 6."

Simply navigate to the NHIS Questionnaires, Datasets, and Documentation page, find the NHIS program installment link you want to use, and download the data from there 9.\n\n\n\n\nDo I Qualify?\nIndividuals seeking to use data for statistical analysis and reporting may submit research proposals to the NCHS Research Data Center (RDC) through the Standard Application Process (SAP) via the ResearchDataGov (RDG) portal 10,11.\nApplicants must fulfill criteria during application review and, in some cases, after approval. The four core criteria below are summarized from the RDG User Guide 12. If additional post-approval steps are required, data-owning agencies contact applicants directly to initiate those processes.\n\n\nIdentification: Researchers verify identity, job title, organizational affiliation, and skill level. Some agencies require U.S. citizenship confirmation.\nTraining: Some agencies require post-approval training on data use, management, confidentiality, and cybersecurity.\nAgreements: Researchers sign agreements such as non-disclosure or data use agreements. Some data sources require security plans outlining data protection methods.\nInvestigation: Researchers undergo background checks.\n\n\n\n\nHow Is My Application Assessed?\nAll applications submitted through SAP are evaluated against the same criteria regardless of the agency or unit, unless required by law or regulation. Full criteria are available in the RDG User Guide and summarized below 12:\n\n\nStatistical Purpose: Data is used solely for statistical purposes, not to identify individuals or businesses, nor for law enforcement, legal cases, or regulatory actions.\nAllowed Use: Researchers plan to use data in compliance with applicable rules and restrictions.\nStatistical Disclosure Limitation: Researchers must employ techniques that protect individual, organizational, or business privacy.\nDemonstrated Need: Researchers must demonstrate that confidential data is necessary for project goals and that publicly available data is insufficient.\nFeasibility: Researchers can achieve project goals with requested data. This is evaluated in three ways:\n\n\n\nProject Design: Detailed planned methods and how technical and logistical needs will be met.\nAgency or Unit Support: Confirmation that agencies can provide space, technical assistance, logistics, and data preparation.\nApplicant Ability: Applicants possess the knowledge, skills, and ability to execute the project.\n\n\n\nMaintaining Public Trust: Projects are expected to maintain public trust and confidence in the agency or unit.\n\n\nAdditionally, the NCHS Review Committee evaluates studies for well-defined public health research questions, benefits to data-providing agencies, and appropriateness of planned outputs (papers, articles, presentations) 13.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nNCHS does not evaluate studies for scientific merit or relevance (substantive, methodological, theoretical, or policy). Study output release is not guaranteed due to privacy concerns and application compliance requirements.\n\n\n\n\nTypical Timeline\n\n  \n  \n    A summary of the application process, including information on when additional reviews may be necessary.\n  \n\n\n\n\n  ×\n  \n  \n\n\n\nUpon receiving applications, assigned RDC analysts and the review committee—comprised of data system representatives and the confidentiality officer—assess applications for approval, disapproval, or revision requests. If denied, researchers receive justification for the decision and may request appeals through SAP 14.\nStudies may require amendments to approved applications. Amendment approvals typically take up to four weeks, but complicated requests may require eight to twelve weeks.\n\n\nStep-by-Step Guide\na. Prepare Your Application Before Completing the Form\nThe RDG portal provides access to applications for data from 13 agencies and 3 units within the Federal Statistical System (FSS), including NCHS. Each agency may have additional application requirements. While the RDG User Guide and RDC Application Process page contain detailed information, researchers are encouraged to contact relevant agencies before submitting applications 10,12.\nExample applications, data dictionaries, and complete details are available on the RDC Application Process page 10. This summary provides an outline and directs researchers to relevant information sources. Contact the RDC at rdca@cdc.gov for further assistance 12.\n\n\nConfirm the study requires restricted data access and that FSS data will meet research needs. Contact all relevant agencies or units to verify that required data can be combined, whether restricted-use, publicly available, or non-FSS.\nSelect a preferred access location and confirm eligibility. Non-U.S. citizens should contact the intended facility before writing proposals to confirm eligibility for data access. Refer to the Data Distribution Centers section for more details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nData access methods and locations may vary, especially if the data comes from different agencies or units within the FSS.\n\n\n\nThe NCHS requires additional documents as *.pdf or *.docx and additional concerns to be addressed beyond the base SAP application. Before starting the application, it is recommended to prepare the following:\n\n\n\nA data dictionary listing all requested variables from publicly available, restricted-use, and non-NCHS data sources, which can largely be created using SAP. Refer to the Providing the Public Use and Non-NCHS Data page for additional guidelines on preparing applications with these data types 15.\nA description of the research methodology and a list of supporting references.\nA detailed description of the intended data product (e.g., paper, journal article, or presentation).\nA timeline for managing the project within a three-year period.\nAn explanation of how the project will benefit NCHS or other data-providing agencies for the Agency Benefits section of the application.\n\n\n\nb. Complete the SAP Application Form\n\n\nIn SAP, search for and select the datasets needed for the study and add them to the checkout basket. Any data added to the same basket will be included in a single application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAdditional data can be added to the application if needed after submission.\n\n\n\nWhen ready to proceed, open the basket and select Start Application. It is recommended that the principal investigator (PI) or co-principal investigator (co-PI) create the application, as only they will be able to make edits after submission.\nIn the application, the researcher will need to provide their information, a description of the project that demonstrates the need for restricted-use data, and upload the required documents as *.pdf or *.docx. The SAP application and some agency- or unit-specific requirements can be found in the RDG User Guide 12.\nSubmit the application for review.\n\n\nc. Review the Committee’s Decision and Finalize the Application\nUpon receiving the application, the RDC director will assign the group an RDC analyst who will work with them throughout the entire process of applying for data, accessing the data, and finalizing the output of their results 13. The RDC analyst will:\n\n\nFacilitate application review and accept NCHS-required confidentiality paperwork.\nAccept payments incurred by data center access.\nCreate datasets by compiling data specified in data dictionaries and linking using designated variables. Analytical datasets are provided during data center visits.\nReview results for disclosure risk and provide them once analysis is completed at data centers.\n\n\nResearchers with approved applications must complete the following steps to prepare for data access and utilization.\n\n\nDiscuss the committee’s approval with the assigned RDC analyst and address any revision requests as needed.\nProvide the RDC analyst with approved data dictionaries, public-use and non-NCHS data, descriptions of desired data linkages with intended final formats, and clearly defined derived variables, including arithmetic code or algorithms.\nComplete the Confidentiality and Disclosure training and forms, then provide them to the RDC analyst.

    "section": "Overview",
    "text": "Overview\nThe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a program designed to assess the health and nutritional status of the U.S. population. Initiated under the National Health Survey Act of 1956, the program initially focused on statistically measuring the extent, distribution, and impact of chronic illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and disabilities through three National Health Examination Surveys (NHES). In the 1970s, the program expanded to include research on diet-disease relationships, where it adopted the name NHANES 3,4.\nNHANES has significantly impacted public health by supplying essential data for developing public health strategies and policies, particularly through its detailed dietary research, which has informed national nutritional guidelines and initiatives to combat chronic diseases 2. NHANES is representative of the U.S. population, utilizing complex, multistage, highly-stratified clusters to randomly select participants, ensuring generalizability to the U.S. population as a whole. The survey design often includes oversampling of underrepresented groups, such as ethnic minorities and vulnerable populations, to enhance research accuracy 4–6.\nThere have been three NHES cycles, five NHANES installments, and four ancillary studies, each using different sampling methods and sometimes focusing on specific populations or health outcomes 7–11. The number of participants enrolled varies between each iteration, typically ranging from 5,000 to 10,000 participants per year 5,6,12–19.\nThe types of data collected include:\n\n\nDemographic Data: Basic demographics like age, gender, race, socioeconomic status, family characteristics, and geographic location information such as state and urbanicity.\nHealth and Medical Examinations: Medical history and records, physical and dental examinations, vision and hearing tests, X-rays, and anthropometric measurements such as height, weight, and body mass index.\nLaboratory Work: Blood, urine, and other biological specimens are collected to test for nutritional biomarkers, environmental exposures, and indicators of infectious and chronic diseases.\nPsychosocial and Behavioral Data: Psychological evaluations including measures of mental health and distress, behavioral assessments covering smoking, alcohol, and drug use, and physical activity and fitness measures.\nQuestionnaire Results: Participants provide self-reported information on a variety of health-related topics, including medical history, health conditions, and behaviors like smoking and physical activity.\nDietary Data: Nutritional status assessments, including dietary intake, nutrient composition, dietary frequency, and 24-hour food consumption recall.\nSpecial Focus Variables: Detailed examinations for chronic conditions including, but not limited to, child growth and development metrics, epidemiologic follow-ups, and specific tests and variables based on subpopulation-focused surveys such as the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES) 7–10,20.\n\n\nBecause NHANES collects data from different individuals in two-year cycles, it is a cross-sectional survey rather than a longitudinal one. The complex sampling design ensures nationally representative results when analyzed with the provided sample weights for each installment.\nResearchers interested in combining cross-sectional iterations for longitudinal research should carefully review the recommendations provided in the NHANES Questionnaires, Datasets, and Related Documentation on the CDC landing page for each program 11. Additional support can be found in:\n\n\nHistorical NHANES Component Matrix 16\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey: 1999–2022 Survey Content Brochure 21\nNHANES Survey Methods and Analytic Guidelines, which consolidates some of the program’s documentation 22\n2017–March 2020 Prepandemic File: Sample Design, Estimation, and Analytic Guidelines for additional details 23"

    "text": "Gaining Access\n\nPublicly AvailableRestrcited Access\n\n\n\nDo I Qualify?\nAll individuals seeking to use the data for statistical analysis and reporting purposes may access and download it.\n\n\nTypical Timeline\nThere are no time constraints for accessing these data.\n\n\nStep-by-Step Guide\nThere are no specific steps required. Simply navigate to the NHANES Questionnaires, Datasets, and Related Documentation page, find the NHANES program installment link you want to use, and download the data from there 11.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nBe aware that combining two different installments or biannual Continuous NHANES datasets requires specific considerations. Refer to the relevant data documentation, the list of helpful resources provided earlier, or any of the webinars and tutorials available for further guidance on handling survey design and protocol differences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo I Qualify?\nIndividuals seeking to use data for statistical analysis and reporting may submit research proposals to the NCHS Research Data Center (RDC) through the Standard Application Process (SAP) via the ResearchDataGov (RDG) portal 24,25.\nApplicants must fulfill criteria during application review and, in some cases, after approval. The four core criteria below are summarized from the RDG User Guide 26. If additional post-approval steps are required, data-owning agencies contact applicants directly to initiate those processes.\n\n\nIdentification: Researchers verify identity, job title, organizational affiliation, and skill level. Some agencies require U.S. citizenship confirmation.\nTraining: Some agencies require post-approval training on data use, management, confidentiality, and cybersecurity.\nAgreements: Researchers sign agreements such as non-disclosure or data use agreements. Some data sources require security plans outlining data protection methods.\nInvestigation: Researchers undergo background checks.\n\n\n\n\nHow Is My Application Assessed?\nAll applications submitted through SAP are evaluated against the same criteria regardless of the agency or unit, unless required by law or regulation. Full criteria are available in the RDG User Guide and summarized below 26:\n\n\nStatistical Purpose: Data is used solely for statistical purposes, not to identify individuals or businesses, nor for law enforcement, legal cases, or regulatory actions.\nAllowed Use: Researchers plan to use data in compliance with applicable rules and restrictions.\nStatistical Disclosure Limitation: Researchers must employ techniques that protect individual, organizational, or business privacy.\nDemonstrated Need: Researchers must demonstrate that confidential data is necessary for project goals and that publicly available data is insufficient.\nFeasibility: Researchers can achieve project goals with requested data. This is evaluated in three ways:\n\n\n\nProject Design: Detailed planned methods and how technical and logistical needs will be met.\nAgency or Unit Support: Confirmation that agencies can provide space, technical assistance, logistics, and data preparation.\nApplicant Ability: Applicants possess the knowledge, skills, and ability to execute the project.\n\n\n\nMaintaining Public Trust: Projects are expected to maintain public trust and confidence in the agency or unit.\n\n\nAdditionally, the NCHS Review Committee evaluates studies for well-defined public health research questions, benefits to data-providing agencies, and appropriateness of planned outputs (papers, articles, presentations) 27.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nNCHS does not evaluate studies for scientific merit or relevance (substantive, methodological, theoretical, or policy). Study output release is not guaranteed due to privacy concerns and application compliance requirements.\n\n\n\n\nTypical Timeline\n\n  \n  \n    A summary of the application process, including information on when additional reviews may be necessary.\n  \n\n\n\n\n  ×\n  \n  \n\n\n\nUpon receiving applications, assigned RDC analysts and the review committee—comprised of data system representatives and the confidentiality officer—assess applications for approval, disapproval, or revision requests. If denied, researchers receive justification for the decision and may request appeals through SAP 28.\nStudies may require amendments to approved applications. Amendment approvals typically take up to four weeks, but complicated requests may require eight to twelve weeks.\n\n\nStep-by-Step Guide\na. Prepare Your Application Before Completing the Form\nThe RDG portal provides access to applications for data from 13 agencies and 3 units within the Federal Statistical System (FSS), including NCHS. Each agency may have additional application requirements. While the RDG User Guide and RDC Application Process page contain detailed information, researchers are encouraged to contact relevant agencies before submitting applications 24,26.\nExample applications, data dictionaries, and complete details are available on the RDC Application Process page 24. This summary provides an outline and directs researchers to relevant information sources. Contact the RDC at rdca@cdc.gov for further assistance 26.\n\n\nConfirm the study requires restricted data access and that FSS data will meet research needs. Contact all relevant agencies or units to verify that required data can be combined, whether restricted-use, publicly available, or non-FSS.\nSelect a preferred access location and confirm eligibility. Non-U.S. citizens should contact the intended facility before writing proposals to confirm eligibility for data access. Refer to the Data Distribution Centers section for more details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nData access methods and locations may vary, especially if the data comes from different agencies or units within the FSS.\n\n\n\nThe NCHS requires additional documents as *.pdf or *.docx and additional concerns to be addressed beyond the base SAP application. Before starting the application, it is recommended to prepare the following:\n\n\n\nA data dictionary listing all requested variables from publicly available, restricted-use, and non-NCHS data sources, which can largely be created using SAP. Refer to the Providing the Public Use and Non-NCHS Data page for additional guidelines on preparing applications with these data types 29.\nA description of the research methodology and a list of supporting references.\nA detailed description of the intended data product (e.g., paper, journal article, or presentation).\nA timeline for managing the project within a three-year period.\nAn explanation of how the project will benefit NCHS or other data-providing agencies for the Agency Benefits section of the application.\n\n\n\nb. Complete the SAP Application Form\n\n\nIn SAP, search for and select the datasets needed for the study and add them to the checkout basket. Any data added to the same basket will be included in a single application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAdditional data can be added to the application if needed after submission.\n\n\n\nWhen ready to proceed, open the basket and select Start Application. It is recommended that the principal investigator (PI) or co-principal investigator (co-PI) create the application, as only they will be able to make edits after submission.\nIn the application, the researcher will need to provide their information, a description of the project that demonstrates the need for restricted-use data, and upload the required documents as *.pdf or *.docx. The SAP application and some agency- or unit-specific requirements can be found in the RDG User Guide 26.\nSubmit the application for review.\n\n\nc. Review the Committee’s Decision and Finalize the Application\nUpon receiving the application, the RDC director will assign the group an RDC analyst who will work with them throughout the entire process of applying for data, accessing the data, and finalizing the output of their results 27. The RDC analyst will:\n\n\nFacilitate application review and accept NCHS-required confidentiality paperwork.\nAccept payments incurred by data center access.\nCreate datasets by compiling data specified in data dictionaries and linking using designated variables. Analytical datasets are provided during data center visits.\nReview results for disclosure risk and provide them once analysis is completed at data centers.\n\n\nResearchers with approved applications must complete the following steps to prepare for data access and utilization.\n\n\nDiscuss the committee’s approval with the assigned RDC analyst and address any revision requests as needed.\nProvide the RDC analyst with approved data dictionaries, public-use and non-NCHS data, descriptions of desired data linkages with intended final formats, and clearly defined derived variables, including arithmetic code or algorithms.\nComplete the Confidentiality and Disclosure training and forms, then provide them to the RDC analyst. Additional forms, documents, and tools are available on the RDC Reference Materials page 30,31.\nWhen invoiced, pay fees incurred by the request and applicable to data access at the intended location and frequency. Complete details are in Fees and Invoicing 32.\n\n\nAmendments for project changes are possible but require additional approval prior to implementation. Common reasons for an amendment include, but are not limited to, changes in the research team, requests for additional variables, new methods, or requests for additional types of output 24. However, if the scope or research question changes, a new application is required instead.\nContact the RDC directly at rdca@cdc.gov for further guidance.\nd. Accessing the Data and Publication Expectations\n\n\nAfter completing the steps in Part C, the RDC analyst will prepare the dataset. Once it is ready, schedule an appointment to access the data at the chosen RDC location. Schedule appointments at least one week in advance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDifferent data centers have different access procedures and may incur additional fees depending on frequency of data access. Refer to the Data Distribution Centers section and associated links for additional guidance.\n\n\n\nUpon completion of analysis, submit an output request to the RDC analyst for review and approval. Full details about requirements and expectations are on the Output Policies and Procedures page 33.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nNCHS does not guarantee that study-generated output will be released due to concerns related to, but not limited to, privacy and alignment with the approved application.\n\n\n\nWhen output is nearly complete, send it to the RDC analyst for review before submitting for publication or distribution. Full details about requirements and expectations are on the Publishing Guidelines page 34.\n\n\n\n\nData Distribution Centers\nNCHS data is available at two types of data centers: the Census Bureau’s Federal Statistical Research Data Centers (FSRDC) and the NCHS Research Data Centers (RDCs). Additional details about preparing to access data at one of these sites can be found on the RDC Location of Access page or their respective subpages: FSRDC and NCHS RDC 24,35–37.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nSubmit an electronic copy of any notes or reference materials needed to the RDC analyst prior to visiting a center.

    "text": "Overview\nMerative advances health and social care by innovatively providing healthcare data and technology solutions for patients, program managers, radiologists, and researchers. They collaborate with over 4,500 healthcare providers, top US health plans, government agencies, Fortune 100 employers, and all leading life sciences companies to drive shared health progress 1,2.\nMerative’s MarketScan Research Databases provide longitudinal, patient-level data that cover the full continuum of healthcare costs and outcomes, including detailed prescription drug information. These databases, with data from over 273 million unique patients across diverse care points, support numerous research applications such as pharmacoeconomic outcome evaluations, economic burden studies, and therapeutic pathway analyses, documented in more than 2,600 peer-reviewed publications 3.\nMarketScan offers several unique advantages: it includes comprehensive patient-level details, tracks the full continuum of care, and provides detailed prescription drug information for longitudinal research. Its large sample size supports studies on unique patient populations, and linked data enhance research across various disease areas, maintaining appropriate claims linkages and HIPAA compliance. Equipped with analytic tools for efficient data exploration, MarketScan facilitates understanding of disease progression, treatment patterns, and health outcomes for patients, employers, health plans, and government entities 3,5.\nThe YBIC license includes the following MarketScan datasets 5:\n\n\nCommercial Database (CCAE): Contains data from active employees, early retirees, COBRA continuees, and dependents with employer-sponsored plans, including lab results. Its table structure includes Inpatient Admissions, Facility Header, Inpatient Services, Outpatient Services, Outpatient Pharmaceutical Claims, Annual Enrollment Summary, Enrollment Detail, and Lab Results. This dataset represents approximately 69 million patients and 8.7 billion records.\nMedicare Database (MDCR): Originally designed for Medicare-eligible retirees with employer-sponsored Medicare Supplemental and Medicare Advantage plans, primarily containing fee-for-service plan data. Its table structure matches that of the Commercial Database and includes both Medicare-paid and employer-paid supplemental insurance amounts, limited to plans where both types of payments are available and evident on claims. This dataset represents approximately 4 million patients and 1.55 billion records.\nMedicaid Database (MDCD): Captures healthcare service use for Medicaid enrollees across various states, covering both fee-for-service and managed care plans. It includes records of inpatient services, admissions, outpatient services, prescription drug claims, long-term care, and demographic variables such as age, gender, Federal Aid, Disability, TANF, and race. This dataset represents approximately 28 million patients and 8.26 billion records.\nDental Database: An independent product that can be linked to specific years and versions of the Merative MarketScan Commercial Database and the MarketScan Medicare Database. This dataset represents approximately 28 million patients and 1.73 billion records.\nCommercial Insurance Weights Database: The Merative MarketScan Commercial (CCAE) and Medicare (MDCR) Databases contain data on individuals with employer-sponsored insurance (ESI), either as primary or supplemental coverage. The MarketScan Commercial Insurance Weights, created using the Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) from the American Community Survey (ACS), project this data to the national population with ESI."

    "text": "Overview\nOverseen and supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the All of Us (AoU) initiative is a precision medicine program that connects researchers, healthcare providers, technology experts, community partners, and the public. It aims to gather longitudinal data from participants with diverse backgrounds, including age, ethnicity, lifestyle, and geographic location, to create effective individualized treatments for these groups. Participation is available at no cost to anyone living in the U.S. 1–3\nCurrently, around 600,000 participants have agreed to share their electronic health records (EHR), completed the first three surveys, provided physical measurements, and donated at least one biospecimen for biobank storage. This effort has resulted in researchers gaining access to over 473,000 electronic health records and 611,000 biospecimens 4.\nThe types of data collected include 5,6:\n\n\nElectronic Health Records: The data is standardized following Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM) standards and is then compiled into eleven tables. These tables include information on basic demographics, visit details, conditions, device usage, labs, and procedures carried out by healthcare providers 7.\nBiosamples And Bioassays (Genomics): Additional samples of blood, saliva, and/or urine are contributed by some participants for genomic sequencing assays.\nSurveys: Each participant fills out core surveys that include questions about basic demographics, socioeconomic information, tobacco, alcohol, and recreational drug use, as well as overall health and daily activities. Participants can also choose to participate in five additional surveys on behavioral health, healthcare access, and family history 8.\nPhysical Measurements: There are three sources for physical measurements: electronic health records (EHRs), an in-person visit for baseline physical measurements, and self-reported height and weight.\nWearable Devices (Digital Health): Participants can choose to share health tracking data from wearable devices, such as Fitbit, which includes physical activity levels, heart rate, and sleep patterns.\nPartnered Research Studies: Program partners can gather additional data and contribute it to the All of Us dataset, such as the Exploring the Mind study done in partnership with the National Institute of Mental Health."

    "text": "Overview\nThe Yale New Haven Hospital System (YNHHS) utilizes an electronic medical record (EMR) system provided by the Epic Corporation. This system digitizes all patient chart information, including medical history, allergies, current medications, laboratory and radiology results, and visit notes. Patients within the YNHHS network—which includes Greenwich Hospital, Bridgeport Hospital, Yale New Haven Hospital, Northeast Medical Group, and affiliated physicians—will have their EMR records maintained in the YNHHS Epic system 1,2.\nYNHHS provides a wide range of medical services, including emergency care, primary care, and over 100 specialties such as oncology, cardiovascular care, and neurology 3. The YNHHS facts and figures section and annual reports indicate that over the past few years, there have been approximately 150 thousand inpatient visits, 3.5 to 4 million outpatient encounters, and 350 thousand emergency department visits annually 2,4,5.\nEpic Cosmos combines inpatient and outpatient charts into unified, longitudinal patient records while removing duplicates that may arise from patients receiving care at multiple Cosmos organizations. The data provided to researchers adheres to HIPAA-defined limited data set standards 8. To enhance patient privacy protections, the de-identified dataset suppresses geographic information, consistently shifts patient dates, and conceals source organizations. Detailed information on individual data element transformation processes is available in the Cosmos Data Domain Encyclopedia and the Data Dictionary (also accessible through the Cosmos portal) 9,10.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeverage Expert Analysis for Your Research Needs!\n\n\n\nThe Research Informatics Office (RIO), operated by the Yale Biomedical Informatics and Computing (YBIC), hosts open office hours every Thursday for researchers using Epic. Contact Soundari Sureshanand to request the Zoom link 11.\nThe Joint Data Analytics Team (JDAT) offers customized reporting and data analysis from the Epic data system, specializing in research support. With a team of 60 informaticists and analysts, JDAT works closely with users to understand their data needs and efficiently retrieve information. JDAT supports projects such as cohort population counts, grant application statistics, retrospective reviews, custom data extracts, and report development 12.\nClick here for directions on submitting a Helix research data request with JDAT, Yale’s customized data warehouse system. Learn more on the Yale Center for Clinical Investigation’s Epic Electronic Health Record SharePoint page, which is also accessible from their For Researchers & Research Professionals webpage 12–14.\n\n\nThe types of data collected in the EMR are continuously expanding. For example, researchers currently have access to the following data 8:\n\n\nPatient Information: Limited demographic details such as age, sex, gender identity, race, ethnicity, location, patient status, and family history, social history elements like tobacco and substance use, birth control, social determinants of health, allergy information, and detailed birth history.\nVisits and Encounters: Patient encounters and admissions including encounter type, classification, department and provider specialties, and visit reasons, as well as clinical notes from various medical documentation and patient experience data from MyChart usage and patient-reported outcomes.\nMedical Data: Diagnoses, clinical and billed procedures, and vital signs such as blood pressure, pulse, temperature, respiratory rate, SpO2 levels, height, weight, BMI, and head circumference.\nLab and Genomics: Lab results such as component-specific results, susceptibility results, and reference ranges, in addition to genomic variant data like allelic state and chromosome details, and biosamples for genomic assays including blood, saliva, and urine samples.\nHealth Assessments: Information on cancer staging, immunizations, and eye exams, with details on stage group, immunization type, and visual acuity.\nSpecialty Data: Records data on hospital-acquired infections and various infection types, surgical procedures, transplant data for liver and kidney transplants, and health tracking data from wearable devices.\nResearch and Analytics: Geographic factors like RUCA and Social Vulnerability Index, risk scores for conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and data from research studies detailing study type, enrollment, and partnered research contributions.\nMiscellaneous: Encompasses peer group information on various types of hospitals, medication data including prescriptions and patient-reported medications, and additional lab results."

An OS upgrade is required if the device does not meet these requirements. An HTML5 web browser (e.g., Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Firefox) is also necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis portal provides primary or alternative access to content depending on your role and work location. For guidance, view the “Accessing YNHH VDI & Epic” document on the RBA SharePoint.\n\n\n\nAn Epic UserWeb profile needs to be created using the YNHH NetID. Remember that the YNHH NetID also serves as the Epic username 22.\n\n\n\nNavigate to Epic UserWeb. If directed to the YNHH log-in portal (sts2.ynhh.org), proceed to the next step. If the Epic UserWeb sign-in page (signin.epic.com) appears, type “Yale New Haven Health System” in the “Find your Organization” search bar and select the appropriate option to continue.\nLog into the YNHH portal (sts2.ynhh.org) using the YNHH User ID.\nFrom the Epic UserWeb main page (userweb.epic.com), request an Epic UserWeb profile.\nComplete the profile using credentials from the associated Epic organization. For instance, use the “@yale.edu” email for Yale University affiliates.\nFollow any setup instructions or verification steps to finalize the account.\n\n\n\nc: Training\n\n\nAll Epic users are required to complete the “Epic Research User Curriculum”, available on the YNHH Learning Management System 23,24.\nUsers of YNHHS Epic data analytic tools, such as SlicerDicer, are expected to be proficient and aware of the tools’ limitations. The following training courses are recommended for researchers intending to use these tools for Epic Reporting tasks:\n\n\n\n“Epic Reporting Fundamentals” - available on YNHH Learning Management System (LMS) 18,25\n“Epic SlicerDicer Fundamentals” - available on the YNHH LMS 18,25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional SlicerDicer Guides\n\n\n\nFor those seeking additional resources to learn how to use Epic’s SlicerDicer tool, it is recommended to review the “SlicerDicer” article available in Galaxy or to access one of the weLearning modules created by the Epic community, which can be found here 26,27.\nAdditional courses offered by JDAT and YNHH are also available for exploration:\n\n\nSlicerDicer-related courses (“Available SlicerDicer Models”, “SlicerDicer Quick Start Guide”, and “SlicerDicer Quick Epic Demo”) - available on the JDAT Analytics Portal 28\n“Epic SlicerDicer E-Learning Course” - available on the YNHH LMS 17,29\n\n\n\n\n\nFor some, a manager or supervisor might assign training modules accessible through the YNHH LMS, the JDAT Analytics Portal, or Epic University. Further information on training expectations can be found in the “DTS Epic Training Course Catalog”. For example, the “Research” section lists mandatory trainings for non-clinical research users. This document is accessible from two locations:\n\n\nThe YNHH LMS: Open the “Epic Course Catalog” embedded document and select the “View our Epic Course Catalog” hyperlink 30.\nThe YNHH IT SharePoint (itstraining.ynhh.org): Click the blue “Training & Support Material” drop-down menu and select “Epic Training”. The catalog is linked in the right “Quick Links” sidebar 23,31,32.\n\n\nIt may be necessary to review role-based training requirements, which can be found in the “Roles and Course Spreadsheet” that is also accessible from both webpages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetraining Requirements for Inactive Users\n\n\n\nUsers who have not accessed YNHHS Epic for a year or longer must complete role-specific training before regaining access 32.\n\n\n\n\nAccessing Requested JDAT Research Data\nAs mentioned above, JDAT provides customized reporting and data analysis from the Epic data system for research projects. Once the approved request is ready, accessing the data may be necessary from the YNHH OneDrive. This can be done by using the Office 365 application installed on the YNHHS VDI. Full details are available in the “Accessing YNHH OneDrive” document on the RBA SharePoint 33.\n\n\nPublications Expectations\nEpic provides data users with a checklist for preparing data for publications, emphasized in the user agreement, “Cosmos Rules of the Road”. The full instructions and expectations can be found in the Galaxy “Cosmos Publication Checklist” article and the “Cosmos Rules of the Road”, which outlines some of the Data Use Agreement terms 34,35.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Privacy: Low Count Suppression\n\n\n\nWhen transferring results off the VDI or sharing SlicerDicer graphs, it is imperative to follow Epic’s process to prevent the exportation of line-level data. No counts less than 10 can be individually noted (report as &lt;11).\nReview the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Cell Size Suppression Policy outlined by the Research Data Assistance Center (ResDAC) for examples of how to appropriately suppress low counts 36.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReporting Citations of Your Findings\n\n\n\nResearchers are obligated to provide a list of citations for any publications or references to their research conducted using Cosmos. This list must be submitted to the Governing Council on a semi-annual basis 35.\n\n\n\n\nIncluded Tools and Applications\nResearchers seeking access to YNHHS Epic data will need a Researcher Basic Access (RBA) account. Qualifying researchers will receive a YNHH NetID and Duo Access, which provides access to 15:\n\n\n\n\nVirtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvides remote access to a YNHHS secure device without requiring the YNHHS VPN. Each device is suited with software such as SQL Server Management Studio, R, Stata, SAS, Office365, and Epic, and is where researchers can access Kamino/CHP. This set up can handling small-to-medium sized data, as well as accessing Epic charts, SlicerDicer, and the Computational Health Platform (CHP) 37.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpic SlicerDicer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess de-identified summary count data representing the entire YNHHS patient dataset for data exploration, analytics, and reporting. While IRB applications are not required for accessing this de-identified data, training is strongly recommended. Refer to the “Step-by-Step Guide” Part C: Training section for more details 12,17.\n\n\nResearchers can also request access to the Epic Cosmos system, which provides de-identified summary count data for all participating Epic systems outside of YNHHS. Learn more on our Epic Cosmos information webpage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComputational Health Platform (CHP)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA secure, compliant, and collaborative high-performance computing cluster specifically designed for clinical data analysis. It is suitable for AI research and development and is well suited for analyzing large volumes of data in various forms (e.g., images, text, structured) 37.\n\n\nThis tool requires advanced data science skills with relational databases, Python, and SQL. Additional details can be found here: OMOP Common Data Model 38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft Office 365\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess Microsoft applications integrated within the YNHHS organization through the VDI. As noted above, this is how you can retrieve JDAT-requested data 33."
