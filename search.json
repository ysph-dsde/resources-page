    "text": "Overview\nSurveillance of the dietary habits of the United States population began with the passage of the National Health Survey Act in 1956. Initially, the focus was on statistically measuring the extent, distribution, and impact of chronic illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and disabilities through three National Health Examination Surveys (NHES). The latter two cycles of NHES focused on the growth and development of children and adolescents. In the early 1970s, this scope was expanded to include research into the connections between diet and diseases with the addition of the National Nutritional Surveillance System to NHES, forming NHANES 3,4.\nThis evolution included incorporating measurements that tracked changes in nutritional status over time, alongside clinical observations and professional assessments of survey participants. The NHANES survey underwent four changes until the protocol was settled in 1999 on the continuously conducted surveillance that is still carried out today 4."

    "section": "Programs",
    "text": "Programs\nThroughout its various iterations, NHANES, and previously NHES from 1960 to 1970, have collected a range of surveys and metrics from differently sized and demographic samples of the U.S. population. While the types of data collected, such as interviews and physician examinations, have remained consistent since the program’s inception, the specific exams and tests have evolved over time. Additionally, the base population varied across iterations, with certain programs intentionally designed to oversample underrepresented ethnic and racial groups or vulnerable populations to enhance research possibilities for these groups.\nAll studies employed a multistage study design with stratified probability samples of loosely clustered individuals within land-based segments. Participants were randomly selected from primary sampling units (PSUs), which were further divided into segments based on geography, eligibility, and housing density. The designation of these PSUs varied with each iteration and was influenced by the intended base population for sampling inclusion. Sampling weights were generated in most iterations to reflect the national population of that stratification at the survey’s midpoint 5–8.\nResults are available in the form of interviews, surveys, physician examinations, and laboratory results. In addition to baseline socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, data collection included anthropometric measurements, medical history, standard dental, vision, and audio exams, X-rays, and blood and urine analyte panels.\n\n\nSpecial Focus Programs and Ancillary Studies\nMost programs were intended to collect information about the United States population as a whole and its various subgroups, while sometimes oversampling age and income groups expected to be more vulnerable to malnutrition 8. The three NHES, often referred to as Cycles I-III, are essentially iterations of NHANES conducted separately to focus on specific age groups individually 9–11.\nThroughout these programs, expert evaluation panels were assembled to assess NHANES’s ability to address key issues. Notably, the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES) (1982-84) was conducted as a complete NHANES iteration with the goal of improving representation among three significant U.S. Hispanic populations: Mexican-American, Cuban-American, and Puerto Rican communities 12,13.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBreaking Ground in Culture-Specific Research\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chapter dedicated to cross-cultural considerations, found in the Plan and Operation of HHANES documentation, acknowledged a need for cultural sensitivity and recognized unknown obstacles to implementation. It specifically noted that insufficient personnel on the core team were from or otherwise knowledgeable about the Hispanic population and cultures. This chapter highlighted that this was the first known attempt by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) to conduct a survey focused on a specific ethnic group. This document details the strategies the team employed to address these shortcomings by hiring qualified personnel and forming task force committees intended to closely evaluate aspects of the program, from translation to survey content 13.\n\n\n\nIn some cases, this prompted the consolidation of existing NHANES and NHES research, the addition of programs to enhance representation, and the initiation of ancillary studies to address specific scientific inquiries not directly supported by the primary programs. Three examples of these initiatives are the Growth Chart (GROWTHCH) (1963-94), the NHANES Epidemiologic Followup Study (NHEFS) (1982-84, 1986, 1987, and 1992), and the NHANES National Youth Fitness Survey (NNYFS) (2012) 14–16.\nResults from multiple follow-ups since the completion of NHANES III in 1994 are available as the NHANES III Augmented Data, Special Studies, and Surplus Sera Data. Some of these results include data generated by research groups through the NHANES Biospecimen program. All data produced with NHANES biospecimens are published as part of the ongoing list of follow-up studies. These projects cover a wide range of topics, including natality, spirometry, hipbone geometry, and sera data from surplus biospecimens 17.\nAdditional information about these special focus programs or ancillary studies can be found on the NHANES Questionnaires, Datasets, and Related Documentation webpage.\n\n\nNote on Combined Data for Longitudinal Research\nA researcher seeking to use this data will need to keep in mind that each survey iteration was conducted with specific differences, where some are more cross-comparable than others. More granular differences are summarized in the Historical NHANES Component Matrix, which compares NHANES programs up to 2006, and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey: 1999–2022 Survey Content Brochure, which summarizes the annual continuous NHANES protocol differences. Additional information is also provided in the respective programs’ Survey Methods and Analytic Guidelines documentation or other manuals, accessible on the CDC landing page for each program 18,19.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nOne project plan for the Continuous NHANES was to allow for survey and content updates to meet emerging public health needs. It is challenging to comprehensively summarize each change made since 1999, as the program has been administered every two years since then. A generalized summary with highlights of major changes is provided in the table above.\nResearchers interested in learning more about detailed protocol changes are encouraged to review the relevant documentation for each year available on the NHANES Questionnaires, Datasets, and Related Documentation webpage, the brochere linked above, or the NHANES Survey Methods and Analytic Guidelines webpage, which consolidates some of the program’s documentation 20,21."

    "text": "Gaining Access\nMost of the data available through NHES, NHANES, and the ancillary programs is publicly available for those wishing to use it for statistical analysis and reporting purposes. Researchers seeking to use the data should review and become familiar with the terms and conditions of the NCHS Data User Agreement, which covers the use of any data available from their office 22.\nSome of the more recent installments of the program offer additional levels of data with restricted access or provide researchers the option to generate their own data through the Biospecimen Program. Restricted data does not contain information that directly identifies participants, such as names, social security numbers, and addresses. However, it does include variables that could be used to identify participants when combined with other information, such as a person’s job or county of residence, and sensitive information.\nExplore the information provided in the tabs below for details on access steps, limitations, and time expectations specific to the types of data you are seeking to acquire.\n\nPublicly Available\n\nDo I Qualify?\nAll persons seeking to use the data for statistical analysis and reporting purposes are allowed to access and download the data.\n\n\nStep-by-Step Guide\nThere are no specific steps required. Simply navigate to the webpage with the NHANES program installment you want to use and download it. Be aware that specific considerations are needed to combine two different installments or biannual Continuous NHANES datasets. Refer to the relevant data documentation or any of the webinars and tutorials available for further directions on how to best handle survey design and protocol differences.\n\n\nTypical Timeline\nThere are no time constraints for accessing these data.\n\n\n\nRestrcited Access\n\nDo I Qualify?\nAll individuals seeking to use the data for statistical analysis and reporting purposes are allowed to submit a research proposal to the NCHS Research Data Center (RDC) through the Standard Application Process (SAP) available through the ResearchDataGov (RDG) portal 23,24.\nApplicants must fulfill the following criteria during the application review process, and in some cases, after application approval. These criteria are summarized from the RDG User Guide. If additional steps are required post-approval, the data-owning agency will contact you directly to initiate those processes.\nIdentification: Verify your identity, job title, organizational affiliation, and skill level. Some agencies require confirmation of U.S. citizenship.\nTraining: Some agencies require training on data use, data management, confidentiality, and cybersecurity following application approval.\nAgreements: Sign agreements such as non-disclosure agreements or data use agreements. Some data sources may require the creation of a security plan outlining how the researcher will protect the data.\nInvestigation: Undergo a background check.\n\n\nHow Is My Application Assessed?\nAll applications submitted through SAP are evaluated against the same criteria, regardless of the agency or unit you are applying to for data, unless required by law or regulation. The full criteria are linked in the RDG User Guide, and summarized below 25:\nStatistical Purpose: Data will be used solely for statistical purposes and not to identify individual persons or businesses, nor for law enforcement, legal cases, or regulatory actions.\nAllowed Use: The researcher plans to use the data in compliance with the applicable rules and restrictions.\nStatistical Disclosure Limitation: The researcher must be able to use techniques that protect the privacy of individuals, organizations, or businesses.\nDemonstrated Need: The researcher must show that confidential data is necessary to support their project goals and that publicly available data is insufficient.\nFeasibility: The researcher is able to achieve their project goals with the requested data. This is evaluated in three ways:\n\n\nProject Design: Detailed methods planned and how the technical and logistical needs will be met.\nAgency or Unit Support: Confirming beforehand that the agency can support the project through space, technical help, logistics, and preparation of the data.\nApplicant Ability: The applicant has the knowledge, skills, and ability to carry out the project.\n\n\nMaintaining Public Trust: The project is expected to help maintain the public’s trust and confidence in the agency or unit.\nIn addition to these criteria, the NCHS Review Committee will assess whether the study has a well-defined research question that addresses a public health concern, whether the results will benefit the agencies providing the data, and the appropriateness of the planned output from the study (e.g., paper, journal article, or presentation) 26.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe NCHS will not evaluate your study to assess its scientific merit nor its substantive, methodological, theoretical, or policy relevance. It also does not provide guarantees that output generated by the study will be released contingent on concerns related, but not limited to, privacy and is in alignment with the approved application.\n\n\n\n\nTypical Timeline\n\n  \n  Click on the image to view larger.\n\n\n\n\n  ×\n  \n  \n\n\n\nUpon receiving an application, your assigned RDC analyst and the review committee—comprising data system representatives and the confidentiality officer—will assess your application for approval, disapproval, or a request for revisions. If your application is denied by the committee, you will be provided with a justification for the decision. Researchers are allowed to request an appeal of the decision through SAP 27.\nAt some point, your study may require an amendment to the approved application. Approval for amendments typically take no more than four weeks, but can take as many as eight to twelve weeks if the amendment request is complicated.\n\n\nStep-by-Step Guide\nThe RDG portal provides access to applications for data from 13 agencies and 3 units within the Federal Statistical System (FSS), including the NCHS. Each agency may have additional expectations for the application process that you will need to include if you are requesting data from them. While many details are available in the RDG User Guide or the RDC Application Process webpage (some of which are summarized here), researchers are advised to contact the agencies or units from which they are requesting data before submitting their application.\nExample applications, data dictionaries, and complete details can be found on the RDC Application Process webpage 23. The summary provided here is intended solely to offer an outline and introduce you to the location of relevant information. You can reach the RDC directly at rdca@cdc.gov for further information 25.\n\n\nConfirm that your study requires access to restricted data and that the data available through the FSS will meet your research needs. Contact all agencies or units responsible for the data to confirm that the data you need can be combined with all of the data required for your analysis, whether restricted-use, publicly available, or non-FSS.\nNOTE: Data access methods and locations may vary, especially if the data comes from different agencies or units within the FSS.\nDecide on your preferred location of access, and confirm that you are eligible to gain access at that location. If you are not a U.S. citizen, it is recommended that you reach out to the facility where you intend to access the data prior to writing your proposal. Refer to the Data Distribution Centers section below for further details.\nThe NCHS requires additional documents as *.pdf or *.docx and additional concerns to be addressed beyond the base SAP application. Before starting your application, it is recommended that you prepare the following:\n\n\n\nA data dictionary listing all the requested variables from publicly available, restricted-use, and non-NCHS data sources. Much of this can be created in SAP. Refer to the Providing the Public Use and Non-NCHS Data webpage for additional guidelines on preparing your application with these types of data.\nDescription of the research methodology.\nList of supporting references.\nDetailed description of the intended data product (e.g., paper, journal article, or presentation).\nTimeline for managing the project within a three-year period.\nIn the Agency Benefits section, you must demonstrate how your project will benefit NCHS or other agencies providing the data.\nDetermine and decide on your preferred access location.\n\n\n\nIn SAP, search for and select the datasets you need for your study, then add them to your basket. Any data added to the same basket will be included in a single application.\nNOTE: You can add additional data to the application if needed after submission.\nWhen you are ready to proceed with the application, open your basket and select Start Application. It is recommended that the principal investigator (PI) or co-principal investigator (co-PI) create the application, as only they will be able to make edits after submission.\nIn the application, you will need to provide researcher information, a description of the project that demonstrates the need for restricted-use data, and upload the required documents as *.pdf or *.docx. The standard SAP application and some agency- or unit-specific requirements can be found in the RDG User Guide.\n\n\nUpon receiving the application, the RDC director will assign your group an RDC analyst who will work with you throughout the entire process of applying for data, accessing the data, and finalizing the output of your results 26. The RDC analyst will:\n\n\nFacilitate the review of your application and accept your NCHS-required confidentiality paperwork.\nAccept payments incurred by accessing the data at a data center.\nCreate your analytical dataset by compiling the data requested in the data dictionary and combining it based on the variables you assign for linking. This dataset will be provided to you when you visit a data center.\nAfter you complete your analysis at a data center, they will review your output for disclosure risk and provide you with the results.\n\n\nApproved applications must then complete the following steps in preparation to access and utilize the approved data.\n\n\nDiscuss the committee’s approval with your assigned RDC analyst and address any requests for revision as needed.\nProvide the RDC analyst with the approved data dictionary, public-use and non-NCHS data, descriptions of desired data linkages with their intended final format, and clearly defined derived variables, including any arithmetic code or algorithms.\nComplete the Confidentiality and Disclosure training and forms, and provide them to the RDC analyst. Additional forms, documents, and tools for this step can also be found on the RDC Reference Materials webpage 28,29.\nWhen invoiced, you will need to pay the fees incurred by your request and applicable to accessing the data at your intended location and frequency of access. Refer to Fees and Invoicing for complete details 30.\nFollowing completion of these steps, the RDC analyst will prepare your dataset. Once ready, set up an appointment to access the data at your chosen RDC location. Please schedule your appointment at least one week in advance.\nNOTE: Different data centers have different procedures for gaining access and might incur additional fees depending on how frequently you intend to access the data. Refer to the Data Distribution Centers section and associated links for additional guidance.\nAfter completing your analysis, you must submit an output request to your RDC analyst for review and approval. Find the full details about requirements and expectations on the Output Policies and Procedures webpage 31.\nNOTE: The NCHS does not provide guarantees that output generated by the study will be released contingent on concerns related, but not limited to, privacy and is in alignment with the approved application.\nWhen you have nearly completed your output, send it to your RDC analyst for review before submitting it for publication or distribution. Find the full details about requirements and expectations on the Publishing Guidelines webpage 32.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAmendments for project changes are possible but require additional approval prior to implementation. Common reasons for an amendment include, but are not limited to, changes in the research team, requests for additional variables, new methods, or requests for additional types of output 23. However, if you wish to change the scope or research question, a new application is required instead.\nContact the RDC directly at rdca@cdc.gov for further guidance.\n\n\n\n\nData Distribution Centers\nNCHS data is available at two types of data centers: the Census Bureau’s Federal Statistical Research Data Centers (FSRDC) and the NCHS Research Data Centers (RDCs). Additional details about preparing to access your data at one of these sites can be found on the RDC Location of Access webpage or their respective subpages: FSRDC and NCHS RDC 23,33–35.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nYou must submit an electronic copy of any notes or reference materials you need to your RDC analyst prior to visiting a center. Hard copies of these materials are not allowed. You are also not allowed to bring electronic communication devices, such as phones, pagers, laptops, into the RDC.\n\n\nYou can request different software products or add-ons, though not all requests will be approved. Be aware that requesting additional software accommodations may delay the approval of your project. Contact the specific RDC where you plan to access your data for further guidance.\n\nFederal Statistical Research Data Centers\n\n\nYou will be assigned both an NCHS RDC analyst and an FSRDC administrator from the location you intend to visit. Both have different roles.\nResearchers must meet physical and information security requirements. They must obtain Census Bureau Special Sworn Status (SSS) and pass a background investigation.\nYou must be affiliated with a university or agency to qualify.\nNon-U.S. citizens are generally encouraged to use FSRDCs.\nIn-person: Census Bureau facilities at partner institutions.\nRemote access: A secure Virtual Desktop Interface (VDI) may be available.\nSoftware Available: Anaconda, Gurobi, Intel Composer, Knittro, MADD, Mathematica, NATLAB, OpenGeoda, R and Rstudio, SAS, Stat/Transfer, Stata, Stata-MP, SUDAAN, and Tomlab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIf you are accessing an FSRDC, the data must be transferred from NCHS after completing all requirements outlined by your assigned RDC analyst seven days prior to your intended visit. These additional steps incur extra costs beyond the NCHS RDC data access fee and may delay data access.\n\n\nPreviously, the roles of RDC analysts were listed. The FSRDC, or Census RDC, administrator will:\n\n\nBe available to answer questions pertaining to SSS, access and entry to a FSRDC location, software availability, and additional, Census fees.\nThey may be available to help develop your application.\nTransfer your output to the NCHS after you complete your analysis at a data center. Your RDC analyst will review your output for disclosure risk and provide you with the results.\n\n\n\n\nNCHS Research Data Centers\n\n\nIn-person: Facilities are located in Hyattsville, MD, Atlanta, GA, and Rockville, MD and are accessible by appointment only at least one week in advance.\nRemote access: The computers are not connected to the internet, so remote access is not possible.\nSoftware Available: Microsoft Office products, R, SAS, Stata, Python, SPSS (v. 19), and SAS-callable SUDAAN.\n\n\n\n\nRequired Documentation\nWhen accessing the data, the researcher will need to provide the following documentation in addition to an approved application:\n\n\nProof of identification, such as a REAL ID.\nCurriculum vitae (CV) for each applicant.\nFor student projects, the student’s advisor must provide an agreement form.\nPermission to use proprietary data.\nRequested output must include Table Shells.\nRequested variables must be provided in a data dictionary format that lists all necessary variables (i.e., restricted-use, public-use, and external) for the research project.

    "text": "Overview\nSurveillance of the dietary habits of the United States population began with the passage of the National Health Survey Act in 1956. Initially, the focus was on statistically measuring the extent, distribution, and impact of chronic illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and disabilities through three National Health Examination Surveys (NHES). The latter two cycles of NHES focused on the growth and development of children and adolescents. In the early 1970s, this scope was expanded to include research into the connections between diet and diseases with the addition of the National Nutritional Surveillance System to NHES, forming NHANES 3,4.\nThis evolution included incorporating measurements that tracked changes in nutritional status over time, alongside clinical observations and professional assessments of survey participants. The NHANES survey underwent four changes until the protocol was settled in 1999 on the continuously conducted surveillance that is still carried out today 4."

    "text": "Programs\nThrough its different iterations, NHANES, and previously NHES from 1960 to 1970, collected various surveys and metrics from differently sized and demographic samplings of the U.S. population. A researcher seeking to use this data will need to keep in mind that each survey iteration was conducted with specific differences, where some are more cross-comparable than others. We briefly discuss these differences here, but additional methadological variations can be found by reviewing the references provided below.\n\nMethods and Representational Differences\nThe following table summarizes critical program features and highlights changes or differences between each program iteration. Although the data types, such as interviews and physician examinations, have remained consistent since the program’s inception, the kinds and scope of exams and tests have changed. The base population also varied, with certain programs intentionally designed to oversample underrepresented ethnic and racial groups or vulnerable populations to improve research possibilities for these groups.\nWe do not spend time distinguishing methodological differences if the same type of exam was conducted with different instruments or protocols. Researchers interested in learning more about these granular differences to assess the possibility of cross-program compatibility are recommended to review the Historical NHANES Component Matrix, which compares NHANES programs up to 2006, and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey: 1999–2022 Survey Content Brochure, which summarizes the annual continuous NHANES protocol differences.

The latter two categories were prepared after the completion of NHANES III.   Data Files: TXT, SAS, or XPT and PDF   NOTE: NHANES III has both publicly available and restricted data files. You can learn more about both by navigating from the primary NHANES III landing page to the Data Files subpage. \n\n\n Core NHANES III data were broadly divided into five assessments: household interviews for adults and youths, examinations, laboratory results, and dietary recalls.

To learn more about both, navigate to the respective data release year accessible from the main NHANES Questionnaires, Data, and Related Documentation webpage.   NOTE: Generally speaking, any 2-year data cycle in Continuous NHANES can be combined with adjacent 2-year data cycles utilizing the same sampling design to create analytic data files based on 4 or more years of data, allowing for greater precision. Protocols are provided in respective documentation to provide direction on how to best combine historical Continuous NHANES data with more current iterations.   NOTE: Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the 2019-20 Continuous NHANES series was suspended in March 2020. Consequently, only 18 of 30 PSUs were recorded, rendering the sample not nationally representative. To compensate, the 2017-March 2020 Pre-pandemic dataset was created. Users should be aware that combining these programs introduces new challenges due to differences in sampling methods and time spans. For additional details, refer to the 2017–March 2020 Prepandemic File: Sample Design, Estimation, and Analytic Guidelines for additional details 27. \n\n\n The list below is intended to provide researchers with a sense of the types of variables captured throughout Continuous NHANES. Not all variables were included in each time and some methods differed between bi-annual implementations.  \n\n\nDemographic\n\n\nSocioeconomic\n\n\nFamily characteristics\n\n\nSampling weights for those interviewed and examined were adjusted to reflect the participants’ respective race, ethnicity, income, and age category in the national population. Note that certain cycles had major changes to their choice of sex-age-race subdomains and oversampling protocols, necessitating additional measures such as weight rescaling when joining different cycles 28,29.\n\n\nSocial support and residence questionnaire for adults\n\n\nGeneral physical examination and central nervous system evaluation\n\n\nBody measurements\n\n\nDental, vision, and hearing examination\n\n\nRespiratory health through exhaled nitric oxide and spirometry\n\n\nBlood and urine assessments\n\n\nLiver ultrasound transient elastography\n\n\nWhole body dual-energy X-ray\n\n\nDietary practices, food frequency and total nutrient intake\n\n\n24-Hour recall\n\n\nMedications and supplements\n\n\nDrug abuse and alcohol use testing and questionnaire\n\n\nTobacco use questionnaire and examination\n\n\nPhysical activity questionnaire for adults and examination for all participants\n\n\nFunctional impairment\n\n\nEnvironmental and occupational exposures, such as pesticides, VOCs, and lead\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10,000 to 12,000 were contacted for each two-year cycle.

A supplemental sample of pregnant women was also included, but they were not an oversampled group 3.   Oversampling 2007-10: Non-Hispanic black persons, Hispanic persons, low-income persons (at or below 130% of the federal poverty line), persons aged 80 years and over 3.   Oversampling 2011-14: The same groups as the 2007-10 study design with non-Hispanic non-back Asian persons 30.   Oversampling 2015-18: The same groups as the 2011-14 study design with low-income persons determined at or below 185% of the federal poverty line and persons 0-11 years old 29.   Oversampling 2019-20: The original design included the same groups as the 2011-14 study design without the 0-11 years old group. Due to the premature suspension of operations in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the data are not nationally representative on their own. These data are available as a convenience sample 25.   Oversampling 2021-23: Efforts to limit participant and staff exposure to COVID-19 led to modifications in every aspect of study design and sampling. To reduce the number of dwellings visited, there was no oversampling of racial or socioeconomic groups. Households with any individuals aged 0–19 years and 60 and older were eligible to participate, while not everyone aged 20–59 years from the same household was included 26. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\n\n\nOne project plan for the Continuous NHANES was to allow for survey and content updates to meet emerging public health needs. It is challenging to comprehensively summarize each change made since 1999, as the program has been administered every two years since then. A generalized summary with highlights of major changes is provided in the table above.\nResearchers interested in learning more about detailed protocol changes are encouraged to review the relevant documentation for each year available on the NHANES Questionnaires, Datasets, and Related Documentation webpage, the brochere linked above, or the NHANES Survey Methods and Analytic Guidelines webpage, which consolidates some of the program’s documentation 24,31.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Focus Programs and Ancillary Studies\nMost programs were intended to collect information about the United States population as a whole and its various subgroups, while sometimes oversampling age and income groups expected to be more vulnerable to malnutrition 16. The three NHES, often referred to as Cycles I-III, are essentially iterations of NHANES conducted separately to focus on specific age groups individually 7,10,12. Throughout these programs, expert evaluation panels were assembled to assess NHANES’s ability to address key issues 20.\nIn some cases, this warranted the consolidation of existing NHANES and NHES research, the addition of programs to enhance representation, and ancillary studies to address specific scientific inquiries not directly supported by the primary programs. These are summarized below, and additional information can be found on the NHANES Questionnaires, Datasets, and Related Documentation webpage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIteration\n\n\nDesign and Data\n\n\nVariable Categories\n\n\nPopulation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowth Chart (GROWTHCH) 32\n\n\n Dates: 1963-94   Study Design: A multistage, stratified probability sample of loose clusters of individuals in land-based segments was used, with specifics applicable to the year of observation.

Different groups were considered, and it was determined that the Hispanic population should be the focus due to notable gaps in comparable data for this population. This was partly due to insufficient representation of Hispanic populations and a lack of separate representation for Mexican-American, Cuban-American, and Puerto Rican communities. HHANES was formulated with the explicit purpose of supporting estimations of the health and nutritional status of the United States Hispanic population so that it is comparable with the general population, while also considering variations between these three specific Hispanic communities 20.\nAdditional study design and content details are provided earlier in the Methods and Representational Differences section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chapter dedicated to cross-cultural considerations, found in the Plan and Operation of HHANES documentation, acknowledged a need for cultural sensitivity and recognized unknown obstacles to implementation. It specifically noted that insufficient personnel on the core team were from or otherwise knowledgeable about the Hispanic population and cultures. This chapter highlighted that this was the first known attempt by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) to conduct a survey focused on a specific ethnic group. This document details the strategies the team employed to address these shortcomings by hiring qualified personnel and forming task force committees intended to closely evaluate aspects of the program, from translation to survey content 20."

    "text": "Gaining Access\nMost of the data available through NHES, NHANES, and the ancillary programs is freely accessible for those wishing to use it for statistical analysis and reporting purposes. Researchers seeking to use the data should review and become familiar with the terms and conditions of the NCHS Data User Agreement, which covers the use of any data available from their office 40.\nSome of the more recent installments of the program offer additional levels of data with restricted access or provide researchers the option to generate their own data through the Biospecimen Program. Restricted data does not contain information that directly identifies participants, such as names, social security numbers, and addresses. However, it does include variables that could be used to identify participants when combined with other information, such as a person’s job or county of residence, and sensitive information.\nExplore the information provided in the tabs below for details on access steps, limitations, and time expectations specific to the types of data you are seeking to acquire.\n\nFreely AccessibleRestrcited Access\n\n\n\nDo I Qualify?\nAll persons seeking to use the data for statistical analysis and reporting purposes are allowed to access and download the data.\n\n\nStep-by-Step Guide\nThere are no specific steps required. Simply navigate to the webpage with the NHANES program installment you want to use and download it. Be aware that specific considerations are needed to combine two different installments or biannual Continuous NHANES datasets. Refer to the relevant data documentation or any of the webinars and tutorials available for further directions on how to best handle survey design and protocol differences.\n\n\nTypical Timeline\nThere are no time constraints for accessing these data.\n\n\n\n\nDo I Qualify?\nAll individuals seeking to use the data for statistical analysis and reporting purposes are allowed to submit a research proposal to the NCHS Research Data Center (RDC) through the Standard Application Process (SAP) available through the ResearchDataGov (RDG) portal 41,42.\nApplicants must fulfill the following criteria during the application review process, and in some cases, after application approval. These criteria are summarized from the RDG User Guide. If additional steps are required post-approval, the data-owning agency will contact you directly to initiate those processes.\nIdentification: Verify your identity, job title, organizational affiliation, and skill level. Some agencies require confirmation of U.S. citizenship.\nTraining: Some agencies require training on data use, data management, confidentiality, and cybersecurity following application approval.\nAgreements: Sign agreements such as non-disclosure agreements or data use agreements. Some data sources may require the creation of a security plan outlining how the researcher will protect the data.\nInvestigation: Undergo a background check.\n\n\nHow Is My Application Assessed?\nAll applications submitted through SAP are evaluated against the same criteria, regardless of the agency or unit you are applying to for data, unless required by law or regulation. The full criteria are linked in the RDG User Guide, and summarized below 43:\nStatistical Purpose: Data will be used solely for statistical purposes and not to identify individual persons or businesses, nor for law enforcement, legal cases, or regulatory actions.\nAllowed Use: The researcher plans to use the data in compliance with the applicable rules and restrictions.\nStatistical Disclosure Limitation: The researcher must be able to use techniques that protect the privacy of individuals, organizations, or businesses.\nDemonstrated Need: The researcher must show that confidential data is necessary to support their project goals and that publicly available data is insufficient.\nFeasibility: The researcher is able to achieve their project goals with the requested data. This is evaluated in three ways:\n\n\nProject Design: Detailed methods planned and how the technical and logistical needs will be met.\nAgency or Unit Support: Confirming beforehand that the agency can support the project through space, technical help, logistics, and preparation of the data.\nApplicant Ability: The applicant has the knowledge, skills, and ability to carry out the project.\n\n\nMaintaining Public Trust: The project is expected to help maintain the public’s trust and confidence in the agency or unit.\nIn addition to these criteria, the NCHS Review Committee will assess whether the study has a well-defined research question that addresses a public health concern, whether the results will benefit the agencies providing the data, and the appropriateness of the planned output from the study (e.g., paper, journal article, or presentation) 44.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe NCHS will not evaluate your study to assess its scientific merit nor its substantive, methodological, theoretical, or policy relevance. It also does not provide guarantees that output generated by the study will be released contingent on concerns related, but not limited to, privacy and is in alignment with the approved application.\n\n\n\n\nTypical Timeline\n\n  \n  Click on the image to view larger.\n\n\n\n\n  ×\n  \n  \n\n\n\nUpon receiving an application, your assigned RDC analyst and the review committee—comprising data system representatives and the confidentiality officer—will assess your application for approval, disapproval, or a request for revisions. If your application is denied by the committee, you will be provided with a justification for the decision. Researchers are allowed to request an appeal of the decision through SAP 45.\nAt some point, your study may require an amendment to the approved application. Approval for amendments typically take no more than four weeks, but can take as many as eight to twelve weeks if the amendment request is complicated.\n\n\nStep-by-Step Guide\nThe RDG portal provides access to applications for data from 13 agencies and 3 units within the Federal Statistical System (FSS), including the NCHS. Each agency may have additional expectations for the application process that you will need to include if you are requesting data from them. While many details are available in the RDG User Guide or the RDC Application Process webpage (some of which are summarized here), researchers are advised to contact the agencies or units from which they are requesting data before submitting their application.\nExample applications, data dictionaries, and complete details can be found on the RDC Application Process webpage 41. The summary provided here is intended solely to offer an outline and introduce you to the location of relevant information. You can reach the RDC directly at rdca@cdc.gov for further information 43.\n\n\nConfirm that your study requires access to restricted data and that the data available through the FSS will meet your research needs. Contact all agencies or units responsible for the data to confirm that the data you need can be combined with all of the data required for your analysis, whether restricted-use, publicly available, or non-FSS.\nNOTE: Data access methods and locations may vary, especially if the data comes from different agencies or units within the FSS.\nDecide on your preferred location of access, and confirm that you are eligible to gain access at that location. If you are not a U.S. citizen, it is recommended that you reach out to the facility where you intend to access the data prior to writing your proposal. Refer to the Data Distribution Centers section below for further details.\nThe NCHS requires additional documents as *.pdf or *.docx and additional concerns to be addressed beyond the base SAP application. Before starting your application, it is recommended that you prepare the following:\n\n\n\nA data dictionary listing all the requested variables from publicly available, restricted-use, and non-NCHS data sources. Much of this can be created in SAP. Refer to the Providing the Public Use and Non-NCHS Data webpage for additional guidelines on preparing your application with these types of data.\nDescription of the research methodology.\nList of supporting references.\nDetailed description of the intended data product (e.g., paper, journal article, or presentation).\nTimeline for managing the project within a three-year period.\nIn the Agency Benefits section, you must demonstrate how your project will benefit NCHS or other agencies providing the data.\nDetermine and decide on your preferred access location.\n\n\n\nIn SAP, search for and select the datasets you need for your study, then add them to your basket. Any data added to the same basket will be included in a single application.\nNOTE: You can add additional data to the application if needed after submission.\nWhen you are ready to proceed with the application, open your basket and select Start Application. It is recommended that the principal investigator (PI) or co-principal investigator (co-PI) create the application, as only they will be able to make edits after submission.\nIn the application, you will need to provide researcher information, a description of the project that demonstrates the need for restricted-use data, and upload the required documents as *.pdf or *.docx. The standard SAP application and some agency- or unit-specific requirements can be found in the RDG User Guide.\n\n\nUpon receiving the application, the RDC director will assign your group an RDC analyst who will work with you throughout the entire process of applying for data, accessing the data, and finalizing the output of your results 44. The RDC analyst will:\n\n\nFacilitate the review of your application and accept your NCHS-required confidentiality paperwork.\nAccept payments incurred by accessing the data at a data center.\nCreate your analytical dataset by compiling the data requested in the data dictionary and combining it based on the variables you assign for linking. This dataset will be provided to you when you visit a data center.\nAfter you complete your analysis at a data center, they will review your output for disclosure risk and provide you with the results.\n\n\nApproved applications must then complete the following steps in preparation to access and utilize the approved data.\n\n\nDiscuss the committee’s approval with your assigned RDC analyst and address any requests for revision as needed.\nProvide the RDC analyst with the approved data dictionary, public-use and non-NCHS data, descriptions of desired data linkages with their intended final format, and clearly defined derived variables, including any arithmetic code or algorithms.\nComplete the Confidentiality and Disclosure training and forms, and provide them to the RDC analyst. Additional forms, documents, and tools for this step can also be found on the RDC Reference Materials webpage 46,47.\nWhen invoiced, you will need to pay the fees incurred by your request and applicable to accessing the data at your intended location and frequency of access. Refer to Fees and Invoicing for complete details 48.\nFollowing completion of these steps, the RDC analyst will prepare your dataset. Once ready, set up an appointment to access the data at your chosen RDC location. Please schedule your appointment at least one week in advance.\nNOTE: Different data centers have different procedures for gaining access and might incur additional fees depending on how frequently you intend to access the data. Refer to the Data Distribution Centers section and associated links for additional guidance.\nAfter completing your analysis, you must submit an output request to your RDC analyst for review and approval. Find the full details about requirements and expectations on the Output Policies and Procedures webpage 49.\nNOTE: The NCHS does not provide guarantees that output generated by the study will be released contingent on concerns related, but not limited to, privacy and is in alignment with the approved application.\nWhen you have nearly completed your output, send it to your RDC analyst for review before submitting it for publication or distribution. Find the full details about requirements and expectations on the Publishing Guidelines webpage 50.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAmendments for project changes are possible but require additional approval prior to implementation. Common reasons for an amendment include, but are not limited to, changes in the research team, requests for additional variables, new methods, or requests for additional types of output 41. However, if you wish to change the scope or research question, a new application is required instead.\nContact the RDC directly at rdca@cdc.gov for further guidance.\n\n\n\n\nData Distribution Centers\nNCHS data is available at two types of data centers: the Census Bureau’s Federal Statistical Research Data Centers (FSRDC) and the NCHS Research Data Centers (RDCs). Additional details about preparing to access your data at one of these sites can be found on the RDC Location of Access webpage or their respective subpages: FSRDC and NCHS RDC 41,51–53.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nYou must submit an electronic copy of any notes or reference materials you need to your RDC analyst prior to visiting a center. Hard copies of these materials are not allowed. You are also not allowed to bring electronic communication devices, such as phones, pagers, laptops, into the RDC.\n\n\nYou can request different software products or add-ons, though not all requests will be approved. Be aware that requesting additional software accommodations may delay the approval of your project. Contact the specific RDC where you plan to access your data for further guidance.\n\nFederal Statistical Research Data Centers\n\n\nYou will be assigned both an NCHS RDC analyst and an FSRDC administrator from the location you intend to visit. Both have different roles.\nResearchers must meet physical and information security requirements. They must obtain Census Bureau Special Sworn Status (SSS) and pass a background investigation.\nYou must be affiliated with a university or agency to qualify.\nNon-U.S. citizens are generally encouraged to use FSRDCs.\nIn-person: Census Bureau facilities at partner institutions.\nRemote access: A secure Virtual Desktop Interface (VDI) may be available.\nSoftware Available: Anaconda, Gurobi, Intel Composer, Knittro, MADD, Mathematica, NATLAB, OpenGeoda, R and Rstudio, SAS, Stat/Transfer, Stata, Stata-MP, SUDAAN, and Tomlab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIf you are accessing an FSRDC, the data must be transferred from NCHS after completing all requirements outlined by your assigned RDC analyst seven days prior to your intended visit. These additional steps incur extra costs beyond the NCHS RDC data access fee and may delay data access.\n\n\nPreviously, the roles of RDC analysts were listed. The FSRDC, or Census RDC, administrator will:\n\n\nBe available to answer questions pertaining to SSS, access and entry to a FSRDC location, software availability, and additional, Census fees.\nThey may be available to help develop your application.\nTransfer your output to the NCHS after you complete your analysis at a data center. Your RDC analyst will review your output for disclosure risk and provide you with the results.\n\n\n\n\nNCHS Research Data Centers\n\n\nIn-person: Facilities are located in Hyattsville, MD, Atlanta, GA, and Rockville, MD and are accessible by appointment only at least one week in advance.\nRemote access: The computers are not connected to the internet, so remote access is not possible.\nSoftware Available: Microsoft Office products, R, SAS, Stata, Python, SPSS (v. 19), and SAS-callable SUDAAN.\n\n\n\n\nRequired Documentation\nWhen accessing the data, the researcher will need to provide the following documentation in addition to an approved application:\n\n\nProof of identification, such as a REAL ID.\nCurriculum vitae (CV) for each applicant.\nFor student projects, the student’s advisor must provide an agreement form.\nPermission to use proprietary data.\nRequested output must include Table Shells.\nRequested variables must be provided in a data dictionary format that lists all necessary variables (i.e., restricted-use, public-use, and external) for the research project. Please refer to the agency dataset data dictionaries for the available variables."
