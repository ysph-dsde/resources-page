Submission directions for these documents can be found on the PDF.\nHuman Subjects Protection Training (HSPT) certificate from CITI completed within the last 3 years. Below is a summary of the process, and the complete directions can be found on the It’s Your Yale page about HSPT. You can reach out to irb.training@yale.edu for further questions.\nResearchers will need to complete the following CITI certificates:\n\n“Basic Training”\nOne of the following two initial/basic Human Subjects Research modules: “Biomedical Research Basic” or “Social Behavioral Educational Researchers Basic”.\n\nFor Yale-affiliates, it is preferable, though not required, to go through Workday to access the CITI training modules. Doing so will expedite recognition of the certificate in the Yale Integrated Research Enterprise Solution (IRES) Institutional Review Board (IRB) system. In Workday, the CITI training link will show up as the “Human Subjects Protection Training – Initial/Refresher” course. You can reach out to your manager, learning@yale.edu, or irb.training@yale.edu to request manual assignment if needed.\nQualifying certificates completed through other institutions CITI subscriptions need to be emailed to irb.training@yale.edu. Please keep in mind that receiving CITI certification independently from a subscribing institution will incur charges."
