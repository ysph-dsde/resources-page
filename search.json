    "text": "Overview\nUK Biobank provides an ongoing clinical study biobank offering the most comprehensive dataset of biological, health, and lifestyle information from half a million participants since initial recruitment in 2006 1,5. Participants were recruited from 22 centers in Scotland, England, and Wales, with over 86% living in urban areas. Since recruitment from 2006 to 2010, these participants have consistently provided data on health records, physical measurements, lifestyle and environment, questionnaires, and biospecimens 1,6.\nThe UK Biobank continually enhances its research value by integrating biomedical data with external sources, collecting additional data points, and generating new data from biospecimens. They have introduced new research initiatives, including lifestyle questionnaires, wearable technology, and one of the world’s largest sleep surveys and whole-body imaging projects 2–4.\nParticipants were aged between 40 and 69 years and living in the UK when they joined the study between 2006 and 2010, with half being female. They represent various socioeconomic backgrounds, with more than 40,000 born outside the UK. Participants tend to be wealthier and healthier than the national average, reflecting a common ‘healthy volunteer bias’ 5–7. Despite this, the sufficient number of participants across various risk levels allows the findings to be broadly generalizable to the UK. 94.6% of participants are of white ethnicity, reflecting the national population at the time of recruitment (94.5% in the 2001 UK Census and 91.3% in 2011). Consequently, the data does not effectively represent disease risk across different ethnic groups 6.\nThe types of data collected include 8:\n\n\nDemographic, Lifestyle, and Self-Reported Health Data: Basic demographics and socioeconomic status; family characteristics like illnesses of parents and siblings; lifestyle habits such as physical activity and diet; sociodemographic factors like education and employment; and various medical conditions including eyesight and mental health 9.\nImaging: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans of the brain, heart, and abdomen, full-body bone density scans (DXA/DEXA) scans, carotid ultrasound images, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) scans, and COVID-19 repeat scans 10.\nBiomarker: 251 metabolic biomarkers, 3,000 proteins using OLINK’s proteomic assays, infectious disease antigens, 34 components in blood and urine, and blood counts including examples such as basophils, eosinophils, neutrophils, red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and haemoglobin 11.\nGenetic: Around 850,000 genetic variants directly measured, more than 90 million variants predicted using statistical methods, whole exomes and genomes, and telomere length 12.\nHealth Records: Coded hospital data for diagnoses and procedures, coded general practitioner (GP) data containing codes about diagnoses, prescriptions, and referrals (excluding confidential notes or letters), cancer diagnoses from national cancer registries, deaths data, and algorithmically classified outcomes based on qualifying diagnostic and/or procedural codes for conditions such as asthma, COPD, dementia, myocardial infarction, and stroke 13.\nPhysical Measurements: Collected during the first “baseline” visit: participants’ height, weight, waist and hip circumference, lung capacity, body composition (muscle and fat mass), hand grip strength, heel bone density, blood pressure, arterial stiffness, vision, hearing, touchscreen tests for memory, fitness level and activity monitored for one week, and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) 14.\nQuestionnaire Results: Some participants completed detailed questionnaires covering topics such as diet (e.g., food preferences and a 24-hour food recall), cognitive function, occupational history, mental health, digestive health, pain, and overall health and wellbeing 15.\nEnvironmental Data: Air pollution near participants’ residences, noise pollution, greenspace in participants’ local areas, the nearby built environment and traffic intensity, the distance of their homes to the coast, and tap water minerals 16."

    "section": "Gaining Access",
    "text": "Gaining Access\n\nData Resource\n\n\n\nDo I Qualify?\nUK Biobank data are made available to eligible researchers from academic, charity, government, and commercial organizations worldwide for health-related research that serves the public interest. Any research using UK Biobank data must aim to positively impact public health and wellbeing while adhering to stringent ethical standards. The research must not cause harm, discrimination, mistreatment, or marginalization of any social groups, thus supporting inclusivity and societal benefit 17.\nTo be eligible to access the data, researchers must demonstrate a proven track record of legitimate health-related research. They must also be affiliated with a recognized research organization and operate from a country that complies with international regulations and is not subject to UK, US, or EU sanctions, as outlined in the UK Biobank International Sanctions Policy 18,19. Additionally, the UK Biobank no longer accepts applications from insurance companies, as specified in the Access to UK Biobank Data section under “Controlling Access” 17.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nUK Biobank ensures compliance with these eligibility requirements by conducting thorough background checks on researchers applying for data access. This is done by trained personnel who verify the legitimacy of the applicants and their research credentials 17.\n\n\n\n\nHow Is My Application Assessed?\nThe application process will involve the UK Biobank Scientific Team and Access Committee (AC), a sub-committee of the UK Biobank Board 20,21. The scientific team will evaluate the information provided in the data request application to determine if the application meets the required access criteria 22.\nThe AC, which meets on a quarterly basis, is responsible for making key access decisions, notably those regarding the use of depletable samples, recontact, or potentially contentious research. The AC will assess the application for 22:\n\n\nThe likelihood of the proposed research receiving approval\nThe proposed research’s compliance with the required access criteria (including legal and ethical standards)\nThe availability of the requisite data and/or samples for the proposed research\nThe scientific justification for the amount of depletable sample required\nThe cost associated with providing the requested data and/or samples\n\n\nThere are four possible outcomes 21:\n\n\nThe UK Biobank Scientific Team approves the application and presents it to the Access Sub-Committee, which may raise any queries.\nThe application is sent back to the Applicant Principal Investigator (PI) for revisions.\nThe UK Biobank Scientific Team recommends the application for denial and escalates it to the Access Sub-Committee, which will review and discuss it. The Sub-Committee may approve or decline the application, providing reasons and suggestions for a successful future application if applicable.\nThe UK Biobank Scientific Team forwards the application to the Access Sub-Committee for detailed consideration and approval due to unusual, contentious, ethical-legal, or other novel issues.\n\n\nAdditional details describing how applications are evaluated, and the responsibilities involved, can be found in the Access Procedures document, available under the section “Key Documents.” Specifically, refer to Section C10, “Roles of the Parties in the Application Review Process” 19,21.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nMost of the details summarized in the remaining sections about “Gaining Access” were sourced from the Access Procedures document 19,21. If any information was supplemented or sourced from other resources, it is cited accordingly.\n\n\n\n\nTypical Timeline\nRegistration is reviewed within 5 days of receipt, and typically no more than 10 working days 23.\nA couple days to register the Access team to review the MRC certificate.\nCosts are per application, and each application grants 3 years of data access once approved, payment received, and Material Transfer Agreement executed.\nAll approved projects will have a minimum of 3 years to conduct their research, with the option to apply for extensions of 12 months, 2 years, or 3 years if necessary 24.\nIt will generally take a matter of weeks from application submission for an application to be approved, but may take longer for complex applications to be approved.\nData is usually released weekly, whereas samples are distributed following a predetermined schedule 22.\n\n\nStep-by-Step Guide\nAll researchers must register, complete training modules, and sign user agreements in the UK Biobank Access Management System (AMS) before they can request data 25. The AMS allows you to manage your portfolio information and check which outstanding trainings need to be completed to gain access.\nData is accessed via the DNAnexus UK Biobank cloud computing portal, Research Analysis Platform (UKB-RAP), provided in conjunction with Amazon Web Services (AWS). UK Biobank offers the opportunity to request data downloads, which are individually assessed and approved by the UK Biobank Access and Scientific Teams. These teams make a recommendation to the Access Committee, which then reviews the application 26. More details on this process can be found below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIt is recommended to use Google Chrome to access the AMS due to identified compatibility issues with certain browsers, such as Firefox and Safari.\n\n\na. Register for Access in the Access Management System (AMS) 27,28\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf your institution is not approved, you will not be able to complete AMS registration until it gains approval to access UK Biobank data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nSome of these answers, along with details of the research the user participates in, are made publicly available on the UK Biobank website. You can find a list of all ongoing, approved projects on their Existing Projects page 29.\n\n\n\n\nRegister for an AMS account for free using your institution’s email address.\nVerify your new account using the 24-hour verification link sent to your registration email.\nTo complete the registration process, log in to the UK Biobank AMS system using your recently verified credentials.\nYou will then see a message window that prompts you to complete your registration by providing additional details about you. The mandatory fields include:\n\n\n\nYour full name, phone number, and date of birth\nAn up-to-date resume/CV in English confirming your current position and institution, OR a link to a personal profile page on your institution’s website\nPubMed reference numbers for up to 5 peer-reviewed publications where you are listed as an author (if available)\nDetails of any complaints raised against you within the past 3 years (if applicable)\nName of the primary institution you are affiliated with that has approved access to UK Biobank data\nYour email address with this institution and used for registration\nYour position at this institution\nList other institutions with which you plan to use the UK Biobank Resource (if applicable)\n\n\n\nThe registration team will review your application and send a message within the AMS portal. They may contact you to request further details.\n\n\nb. Complete the Training Modules 25\nThe Home page of your AMS portal will display notices about mandatory training along with any announcements or important information. Outstanding training module requests can be found on the Profile page in the “Training” section. Additionally, you can find previously uploaded Medical Research Council (MRC) certificates there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou must annually complete the MRC course “Research, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) & Confidentiality” and upload the passing certificate 27. You may also be asked to recomplete the two introductory courses and their accompanying multiple-choice tests.\n\n\n\n\nComplete the MRC course “Research, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) & Confidentiality”, which consists of 10 short video. If this is your first time logging into the MRC Centre for Research Policy Learning Management System, you will need to first create and verify a new account.\nTake the MRC course 10-question multiple-choice quiz. You must pass with a score of 70% or higher for the certificate to be accepted by the Access team.\nSave a PDF copy of the passing completion certificate and upload it in the “Upload MRC Certificate” section of your AMS Profile page.\nComplete the course video “Introduction to using UK Biobank” 30.\nComplete the course video “Introduction to the UK Biobank Research Analysis Platform (RAP)” 31.\nTake the two multiple-choice tests, found in the “Training” section of your AMS Profile page. You must pass with a score of 80% or higher on both tests to complete the process.\n\n\nThe three listed courses are mandatory to gain access. Additionally, UK Biobank has recently released the “Code Repository” course, which includes its own multiple-choice test 32.\nc. Apply to Receive Data 17,28\nOnce registration is completed, an “Applications” page link will appear in the sidebar 22. There are two options when requesting access to data: data only or data and biospecimens. Both application types have distinct features but follow similar review processes, which are summarized below. Researchers can find specific details about the application contents in their AMS portals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nSome of these answers, along with details of the research the user participates in, are made publicly available on the UK Biobank website. You can find a list of all ongoing, approved projects on their Existing Projects page 29.\n\n\n\n\nThe applicant PI must complete and submit an application for either data only or data and biospecimens. Some of the fields in the application might include:\n\n\n\nA summary of the research you intend to conduct in the project, including the research questions, objectives, and scientific rationale (displayed publicly)\nKeywords describing the research\nConfirmations that the research will be used to perform health-related research and ultimately aims to improve public health\nThe type and size of the data requested\nConfirmation if your research requires biospecimens, and if recontacting participants is needed\nDescription of the methods\nA statement if the study will result in the generation of new data\n\n\n\nList all project collaborators along with their contact details. Additionally, you must include contact information for a signatory authorized to sign the Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) on behalf of each institution collaborators are from.\nIndicate the tier of data you are requesting, as each tier comes with different associated costs. For more information on the fees, visit the biobank’s Fee Structure page 33.\nSubmit the form for review by the UK Biobank Scientific Team and AC, which meets quarterly. Refer to the previous section titled “How Is My Application Assessed?” for more details about this process.\nApproved applications will require the execution of the MTA and payment of access charges within 90 days of receiving the notice. Only then will the data and/or samples be released to the Applicant PI 22.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nData is usually released weekly, whereas samples are distributed following a predetermined schedule 22.\n\n\n\nIf your application was rejected, you can apply for reconsideration, as detailed in Section C4.4-5 of “Application Reviewed” found in the Access Procedures document available under the section “Key Documents” 19,21.\nd. Accessing the Data\n\n\nApproved applications with a signed MTA and paid fees will have a project status of “Underway” on AMS, enabling associated researchers to access the data in the UKB-RAP 25.\nCreate a DNAnexus account and associate it with your UK Biobank AMS account: Connect Your Account to UK Biobank.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nThere is no additional charge by UK Biobank to access the RAP. However, certain activities within the RAP will incur costs payable to the platform provider, DNAnexus. These include fees for data storage (both uploaded and derived data), computing and analysis (based on instance type), and data transfer charges. To assist researchers in managing these costs, UK Biobank provides an initial £40 of credit towards these expenses upon joining UKB-RAP 33.\nIn addition to signing agreements with UK Biobank, researchers using the RAP will also need to accept certain terms and conditions to use DNAnexus. These terms can be found on their Subscription Terms of Service page 34.\n\n\n\nAll approved projects will have a minimum of 3 years to conduct their research, with the option to apply for extensions of 12 months, 2 years, or 3 years if necessary 24.\nTo maintain access for the duration of a research project, the researcher must do the following. For more details about how UK Biobank expects PIs and researchers to manage ongoing projects, refer to the Step 4: Manage your project list of articles 19,35.\n\n\n\nAll researchers must keep their information in the AMS updated and ensure their training is current 19.\nApplicant PIs and Lead Investigators at Collaborator Institutions must annually submit a project report, confirming project affiliates, compliance with the MTA, security expectations, and providing project updates along with an outline of activities planned for the next 12 months. For more details, refer to Submitting an annual report 36.\n\n\n\nResearchers are expected to promptly notify the UK Biobank when their project has been completed, regardless of the remaining time allowed to complete the project.\n\n\n\n\nReturn of Results and Publication Expectations\nThe UK Biobank has specific expectations and procedures for conducting research using their data, including the handling of generated results, the code used to analyze data, and any form of publication of findings. Some of these are summarized below.\nResearchers are encouraged to review the Guidance on Researcher Responsibilities and Step 5: Return your results pages, as well as Section B8 “Publication of findings, summary datasets and return of results” in the Access Procedures document, available under the “Key Documents” section, to fully understand these expectations 19,21,37,38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe UK Biobank provides specific guidelines for acknowledgments in publications, reports, and press releases. These can be reviewed in the previously linked articles and on their Communications guidelines page 39. For example, you must include the following statement in the Acknowledgments section of your paper or wherever possible in reference search tools 40:\n\n“This research has been conducted using the UK Biobank Resource under Application Number xxxxx.”\n\n\n\nSummary of the Return of Results 38\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther, when a researcher has completed their analysis, there is an option to return data via the RAP directly to UK Biobank.\nB8.7 Within the earlier of 6 months of publication or 12 months of when the Approved Research Project was completed, the Applicant PI is required to provide the results data behind them, for inclusion in the Resource in such detail and format as UK Biobank reasonably requires.\nB8.8 UK Biobank acknowledges that many publications require the publication of summary data tables alongside the main article. UK Biobank supports this approach but would note that such summary data table should not include any Participant Level Data. The summary data should also be returned to UK Biobank as part of the results data.\nTo return the results data to UK Biobank – the data which underpins the findings – within 6 months of publication of the findings. This includes findings published on preprint servers, unless the same research has been submitted for peer review to an alternate journal within this 6-month timeframe.\nSummary of Publication Expectations 37,40\n\n\nResearchers are expected to publish a commensurate level of findings within the first 3 years of receiving approval for their research project. If this is not possible, the Applicant PI must provide a reasonable explanation, such as in the annual project report, detailing why this is not feasible and providing an estimation of when the findings can be published.\nResearchers are expected to publish their findings in an academic journal or via an open-source publication site as soon as possible after the project’s completion, and no later than 6 months afterward.\nUK Biobank supports publishing summary data tables, scans, and images alongside main articles but notes that these should not include any Participant Level Data or features that might be identifiable, such as reconstructions of the head and skull.\n\nYou are encouraged to contact UK Biobank regarding any concerns about using summary data tables, scans, and images at access@ukbiobank.ac.uk prior to submitting the publication.\n\nUK Biobank does not require the PI to obtain approval before publishing. However, the Applicant PI must provide a copy of any report on their project’s findings and/or any press release to UK Biobank at least 2 weeks before the first public presentation or publication (e.g., meeting abstract, online report, pre-print server, and journal).\n\nThis notification can be fulfilled by submitting a request or submitting the materials through the AMS.\n\nFor press releases, especially those likely to provoke controversy or attract significant public attention, the Applicant PI must follow the Communications guidelines and share a copy of the release with the UK Biobank communications team at communications@ukbiobank.ac.uk 39.\n\n\nTo use UK Biobank scans or images in a publication, you will need to submit a request with the image and Project ID. Any approved images should include the following acknowledgment:\n\n\nReproduced by kind permission of UK Biobank ©\n\n\nYou must acknowledge any data linked to in your analysis. For example:\n\n\n“this work uses data provided by patients and collected by the NHS as part of their care and support.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nResearchers are not obliged to, but may choose to publicize their code, example notebooks, or tools so that they can be freely used by other researchers within the RAP.\nThose interested in doing so might consider taking the additional “Code Repository” course in AMS, which includes its own multiple-choice test. Researchers should also review the UK Biobank GitHub for code support, including tools like the UKB-Git-Audit-Tool, which scans the project’s Git commit history for any potentially confidential information 32,41.\n\n\n\n\nRequesting Downloading Data\nIn the past, researchers had to download requested data and agree to delete it upon completing their study. With the introduction of the UK Biobank RAP, researchers are now encouraged to access all data for their research directly on the platform. However, there may be extenuating circumstances that the UKB-RAP cannot accommodate. For example, researchers might:\n\n\nRequire tools or specialized software not yet integrated with the UKB-RAP\nFace prohibitive costs for specific cloud-based analyses\nRequire substantial compute power (GPUs) that exceeds the current capacity of the UKB-RAP\n\n\nTo ensure accessibility for health-related research, the UK Biobank AC will assess applications to download certain types of data. You can find the full exemption policy here: UK Biobank exemptions from the UKB-RAP by default policy 26. If approved, researchers will then be allowed to temporarily download the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAll projects with approval to temporarily download data will be subject to Tier 3 fees 33.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nCertain large datasets, including the Whole Genome Sequence data and the Whole Exome Sequence data, will only be available through the RAP. Researchers are expected not to attempt to circumvent the requirement to access these datasets solely via the RAP. For example, researchers must not make minor modifications (such as adding a ‘0’ to the data content) and then treat the data as derived to qualify for download.\n\n\nFor more information about UK Biobank’s policies and common FAQs on downloading data, please refer to the Downloading data page 42.\n\n\nFinancial Support 43\nUK Biobank offers reduced access fees for researchers from Low and Low-Middle Income Countries and for postgraduate students. With the reduced fee, you will be able to access all datasets through the RAP but will not have permission to request waivers to download any data 33.\nFor students seeking reduced fees, you will need to meet the following criteria:\n\n\nThe application must be submitted by a student or their supervisor exclusively for the purpose of completing a postgraduate student project (e.g., MSc, PhD, or equivalent). The student must be the lead author of any resulting publications.\nThe application is not allowed to be used for other research purposes, nor can it be utilized for multiple student (or other) projects.\nCollaborators must have a specific and relevant role in the student’s research project and may only be included at the discretion of UK Biobank.\n\n\nYou can learn more about applying for Financial Support on the UK Biobank page dedicated to this topic."

    "section": "Overview",
    "text": "Overview\nThe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a program designed to assess the health and nutritional status of the U.S. population. Initiated under the National Health Survey Act of 1956, the program initially focused on statistically measuring the extent, distribution, and impact of chronic illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and disabilities through three National Health Examination Surveys (NHES). In the 1970s, the program expanded to include research on diet-disease relationships, where it adopted the name NHANES 3,4.\nNHANES has significantly impacted public health by supplying essential data for developing public health strategies and policies, particularly through its detailed dietary research, which has informed national nutritional guidelines and initiatives to combat chronic diseases 2. NHANES is representative of the U.S. population, utilizing complex, multistage, highly-stratified clusters to randomly select participants, ensuring generalizability to the U.S. population as a whole. The survey design often includes oversampling of underrepresented groups, such as ethnic minorities and vulnerable populations, to enhance research accuracy 4–6.\nThere have been three NHES cycles, five NHANES installments, and four ancillary studies, each using different sampling methods and sometimes focusing on specific populations or health outcomes 7–11. The number of participants enrolled varies between each iteration, typically ranging from 5,000 to 10,000 participants per year 5,6,12–19.\nThe types of data collected include:\n\n\nDemographic Data: Basic demographics like age, gender, race, socioeconomic status, family characteristics, and geographic location information such as state and urbanicity.\nHealth and Medical Examinations: Medical history and records, physical and dental examinations, vision and hearing tests, X-rays, and anthropometric measurements such as height, weight, and body mass index.\nLaboratory Work: Blood, urine, and other biological specimens are collected to test for nutritional biomarkers, environmental exposures, and indicators of infectious and chronic diseases.\nPsychosocial and Behavioral Data: Psychological evaluations including measures of mental health and distress, behavioral assessments covering smoking, alcohol, and drug use, and physical activity and fitness measures.\nQuestionnaire Results: Participants provide self-reported information on a variety of health-related topics, including medical history, health conditions, and behaviors like smoking and physical activity.\nDietary Data: Nutritional status assessments, including dietary intake, nutrient composition, dietary frequency, and 24-hour food consumption recall.\nSpecial Focus Variables: Detailed examinations for chronic conditions including, but not limited to, child growth and development metrics, epidemiologic follow-ups, and specific tests and variables based on subpopulation-focused surveys such as the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES) 7–10,20.\n\n\nBecause NHANES collects data from different individuals in two-year cycles, it is a cross-sectional survey rather than a longitudinal one. The complex sampling design ensures nationally representative results when analyzed with the provided sample weights for each installment.\nResearchers interested in combining cross-sectional iterations for longitudinal research should carefully review the recommendations provided in the NHANES Questionnaires, Datasets, and Related Documentation on the CDC landing page for each program 11. Additional support can be found in:\n\n\nHistorical NHANES Component Matrix 16\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey: 1999–2022 Survey Content Brochure 21\nNHANES Survey Methods and Analytic Guidelines, which consolidates some of the program’s documentation 22\n2017–March 2020 Prepandemic File: Sample Design, Estimation, and Analytic Guidelines for additional details 23"

Simply navigate to the page with the NHANES program installment you want to use and download it. Be aware that specific considerations are needed to combine two different installments or biannual Continuous NHANES datasets. Refer to the relevant data documentation or any of the webinars and tutorials available for further directions on how to best handle survey design and protocol differences.\n\n\n\n\nDo I Qualify?\nAll individuals seeking to use the data for statistical analysis and reporting purposes are allowed to submit a research proposal to the NCHS Research Data Center (RDC) through the Standard Application Process (SAP) available through the ResearchDataGov (RDG) portal 24,25.\nApplicants must fulfill the following criteria during the application review process, and in some cases, after application approval. These criteria are summarized from the RDG User Guide. If additional steps are required post-approval, the data-owning agency will contact you directly to initiate those processes.\nIdentification: Verify your identity, job title, organizational affiliation, and skill level. Some agencies require confirmation of U.S. citizenship.\nTraining: Some agencies require training on data use, data management, confidentiality, and cybersecurity following application approval.\nAgreements: Sign agreements such as non-disclosure agreements or data use agreements. Some data sources may require the creation of a security plan outlining how the researcher will protect the data.\nInvestigation: Undergo a background check.\n\n\nHow Is My Application Assessed?\nAll applications submitted through SAP are evaluated against the same criteria, regardless of the agency or unit you are applying to for data, unless required by law or regulation. The full criteria are linked in the RDG User Guide, and summarized below 26:\nStatistical Purpose: Data will be used solely for statistical purposes and not to identify individual persons or businesses, nor for law enforcement, legal cases, or regulatory actions.\nAllowed Use: The researcher plans to use the data in compliance with the applicable rules and restrictions.\nStatistical Disclosure Limitation: The researcher must be able to use techniques that protect the privacy of individuals, organizations, or businesses.\nDemonstrated Need: The researcher must show that confidential data is necessary to support their project goals and that publicly available data is insufficient.\nFeasibility: The researcher is able to achieve their project goals with the requested data. This is evaluated in three ways:\n\n\nProject Design: Detailed methods planned and how the technical and logistical needs will be met.\nAgency or Unit Support: Confirming beforehand that the agency can support the project through space, technical help, logistics, and preparation of the data.\nApplicant Ability: The applicant has the knowledge, skills, and ability to carry out the project.\n\n\nMaintaining Public Trust: The project is expected to help maintain the public’s trust and confidence in the agency or unit.\nIn addition to these criteria, the NCHS Review Committee will assess whether the study has a well-defined research question that addresses a public health concern, whether the results will benefit the agencies providing the data, and the appropriateness of the planned output from the study (e.g., paper, journal article, or presentation) 27.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe NCHS will not evaluate your study to assess its scientific merit nor its substantive, methodological, theoretical, or policy relevance. It also does not provide guarantees that output generated by the study will be released contingent on concerns related, but not limited to, privacy and is in alignment with the approved application.\n\n\n\n\nTypical Timeline\n\n  \n  \n    A summary of the application process, including information on when additional reviews may be necessary.\n  \n\n\n\n\n  ×\n  \n  \n\n\n\nUpon receiving an application, your assigned RDC analyst and the review committee—comprising data system representatives and the confidentiality officer—will assess your application for approval, disapproval, or a request for revisions. If your application is denied by the committee, you will be provided with a justification for the decision. Researchers are allowed to request an appeal of the decision through SAP 28.\nAt some point, your study may require an amendment to the approved application. Approval for amendments typically take no more than four weeks, but can take as many as eight to twelve weeks if the amendment request is complicated.\n\n\nStep-by-Step Guide\na. Prepare Your Application Before Completing the Form\nThe RDG portal provides access to applications for data from 13 agencies and 3 units within the Federal Statistical System (FSS), including the NCHS. Each agency may have additional expectations for the application process that you will need to include if you are requesting data from them. While many details are available in the RDG User Guide or the RDC Application Process page (some of which are summarized here), researchers are advised to contact the agencies or units from which they are requesting data before submitting their application.\nExample applications, data dictionaries, and complete details can be found on the RDC Application Process page 24. The summary provided here is intended solely to offer an outline and introduce you to the location of relevant information. You can reach the RDC directly at rdca@cdc.gov for further information 26.\n\n\nConfirm that your study requires access to restricted data and that the data available through the FSS will meet your research needs. Contact all agencies or units responsible for the data to confirm that the data you need can be combined with all of the data required for your analysis, whether restricted-use, publicly available, or non-FSS.\nNOTE: Data access methods and locations may vary, especially if the data comes from different agencies or units within the FSS.\nDecide on your preferred location of access, and confirm that you are eligible to gain access at that location. If you are not a U.S. citizen, it is recommended that you reach out to the facility where you intend to access the data prior to writing your proposal. Refer to the Data Distribution Centers section below for further details.\nThe NCHS requires additional documents as *.pdf or *.docx and additional concerns to be addressed beyond the base SAP application. Before starting your application, it is recommended that you prepare the following:\n\n\n\nA data dictionary listing all the requested variables from publicly available, restricted-use, and non-NCHS data sources. Much of this can be created in SAP. Refer to the Providing the Public Use and Non-NCHS Data page for additional guidelines on preparing your application with these types of data.\nDescription of the research methodology.\nList of supporting references.\nDetailed description of the intended data product (e.g., paper, journal article, or presentation).\nTimeline for managing the project within a three-year period.\nIn the Agency Benefits section, you must demonstrate how your project will benefit NCHS or other agencies providing the data.\nDetermine and decide on your preferred access location.\n\n\n\nb. Complete the SAP Application Form\n\n\nIn SAP, search for and select the datasets you need for your study, then add them to your basket. Any data added to the same basket will be included in a single application.\nNOTE: You can add additional data to the application if needed after submission.\nWhen you are ready to proceed with the application, open your basket and select Start Application. It is recommended that the principal investigator (PI) or co-principal investigator (co-PI) create the application, as only they will be able to make edits after submission.\nIn the application, you will need to provide researcher information, a description of the project that demonstrates the need for restricted-use data, and upload the required documents as *.pdf or *.docx. The standard SAP application and some agency- or unit-specific requirements can be found in the RDG User Guide.\nSubmit the application for review.\n\n\nc. Review the Committee’s Decision and Finalize the Application\nUpon receiving the application, the RDC director will assign your group an RDC analyst who will work with you throughout the entire process of applying for data, accessing the data, and finalizing the output of your results 27. The RDC analyst will:\n\n\nFacilitate the review of your application and accept your NCHS-required confidentiality paperwork.\nAccept payments incurred by accessing the data at a data center.\nCreate your analytical dataset by compiling the data requested in the data dictionary and combining it based on the variables you assign for linking. This dataset will be provided to you when you visit a data center.\nAfter you complete your analysis at a data center, they will review your output for disclosure risk and provide you with the results.\n\n\nApproved applications must then complete the following steps in preparation to access and utilize the approved data.\n\n\nDiscuss the committee’s approval with your assigned RDC analyst and address any requests for revision as needed.\nProvide the RDC analyst with the approved data dictionary, public-use and non-NCHS data, descriptions of desired data linkages with their intended final format, and clearly defined derived variables, including any arithmetic code or algorithms.\nComplete the Confidentiality and Disclosure training and forms, and provide them to the RDC analyst. Additional forms, documents, and tools for this step can also be found on the RDC Reference Materials page 29,30.\nWhen invoiced, you will need to pay the fees incurred by your request and applicable to accessing the data at your intended location and frequency of access. Refer to Fees and Invoicing for complete details 31.\n\n\nd. Accessing the Data and Publication Expectations\n\n\nAfter completing the steps in Part C, the RDC analyst will prepare your dataset. Once it is ready, set up an appointment to access the data at your chosen RDC location. Please schedule your appointment at least one week in advance.\nNOTE: Different data centers have different procedures for gaining access and might incur additional fees depending on how frequently you intend to access the data. Refer to the Data Distribution Centers section and associated links for additional guidance.\nUpon completion of your analysis, you must submit an output request to your RDC analyst for review and approval. Find the full details about the requirements and expectations on the Output Policies and Procedures page 32.\nNOTE: The NCHS does not provide guarantees that output generated by the study will be released contingent on concerns related, but not limited to, privacy and is in alignment with the approved application.\nWhen you have nearly completed your output, send it to your RDC analyst for review before submitting it for publication or distribution. Find the full details about requirements and expectations on the Publishing Guidelines page 33.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAmendments for project changes are possible but require additional approval prior to implementation. Common reasons for an amendment include, but are not limited to, changes in the research team, requests for additional variables, new methods, or requests for additional types of output 24. However, if you wish to change the scope or research question, a new application is required instead.\nContact the RDC directly at rdca@cdc.gov for further guidance.\n\n\n\n\nData Distribution Centers\nNCHS data is available at two types of data centers: the Census Bureau’s Federal Statistical Research Data Centers (FSRDC) and the NCHS Research Data Centers (RDCs). Additional details about preparing to access your data at one of these sites can be found on the RDC Location of Access page or their respective subpages: FSRDC and NCHS RDC 24,34–36.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nYou must submit an electronic copy of any notes or reference materials you need to your RDC analyst prior to visiting a center. Hard copies of these materials are not allowed. You are also not allowed to bring electronic communication devices, such as phones, pagers, laptops, into the RDC.\n\n\nYou can request different software products or add-ons, though not all requests will be approved. Be aware that requesting additional software accommodations may delay the approval of your project. Contact the specific RDC where you plan to access your data for further guidance.\n\nFederal Statistical Research Data Centers\n\n\nYou will be assigned both an NCHS RDC analyst and an FSRDC administrator from the location you intend to visit. Both have different roles.\nResearchers must meet physical and information security requirements. They must obtain Census Bureau Special Sworn Status (SSS) and pass a background investigation.\nYou must be affiliated with a university or agency to qualify.\nNon-U.S. citizens are generally encouraged to use FSRDCs.\nIn-person: Census Bureau facilities at partner institutions.\nRemote access: A secure Virtual Desktop Interface (VDI) may be available.\nSoftware Available: Anaconda, Gurobi, Intel Composer, Knittro, MADD, Mathematica, NATLAB, OpenGeoda, R and Rstudio, SAS, Stat/Transfer, Stata, Stata-MP, SUDAAN, and Tomlab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIf you are accessing an FSRDC, the data must be transferred from NCHS after completing all requirements outlined by your assigned RDC analyst seven days prior to your intended visit. These additional steps incur extra costs beyond the NCHS RDC data access fee and may delay data access.\n\n\nPreviously, the roles of RDC analysts were listed. The FSRDC, or Census RDC, administrator will:\n\n\nBe available to answer questions pertaining to SSS, access and entry to a FSRDC location, software availability, and additional, Census fees.\nThey may be available to help develop your application.\nTransfer your output to the NCHS after you complete your analysis at a data center. Your RDC analyst will review your output for disclosure risk and provide you with the results.\n\n\n\n\nNCHS Research Data Centers\n\n\nIn-person: Facilities are located in Hyattsville, MD, Atlanta, GA, and Rockville, MD and are accessible by appointment only at least one week in advance.\nRemote access: The computers are not connected to the internet, so remote access is not possible.\nSoftware Available: Microsoft Office products, R, SAS, Stata, Python, SPSS (v. 19), and SAS-callable SUDAAN.\n\n\n\n\nRequired Documentation\nWhen accessing the data, the researcher will need to provide the following documentation in addition to an approved application:\n\n\nProof of identification, such as a REAL ID.\nCurriculum vitae (CV) for each applicant.\nFor student projects, the student’s advisor must provide an agreement form.\nPermission to use proprietary data.\nRequested output must include Table Shells.\nRequested variables must be provided in a data dictionary format that lists all necessary variables (i.e., restricted-use, public-use, and external) for the research project. Please refer to the agency dataset data dictionaries for the available variables."

    "text": "Overview\nThe Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) is supported by the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) Surveillance Research Program (SRP), which provides national leadership in cancer surveillance science and offers the tools and expertise necessary for collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and disseminating reliable population-based statistics. Since 1973, SEER has provided vital cancer statistics, growing to cover 45.9% of the US population across 22 geographic areas with its data on cancer incidence and survival. To date, they have recorded as many as approximately 17 million cases in some of their registries, almost 16 million of which represent malignant cases 1,2.\nSEER data includes patient demographics, tumor characteristics, initial treatments, and survival outcomes, offering significant representation of various racial and ethnic groups across the nation 2,7. The data is collected from participating cancer registries, which can be either population-based or hospital-based, with special registries focusing on specific cancers 8.\nThe types of data products available include 3,7,9,10:\n\n\nSEER Research Data: The standard SEER data, which provides information on cancer incidence and survival from population-based cancer registries. The data encompasses patient demographics, primary tumor site, tumor morphology, stage at diagnosis, extent and history of the disease, initial treatments, and survival outcomes.\nSEER Research Plus and NCCR Data: This expanded category includes all the SEER Research Data as well as additional variables and detailed information not included in the standard dataset, such as geography, month in addition to year of diagnosis, and other demographic fields. It also encompasses data from the National Childhood Cancer Registry (NCCR), offering a more comprehensive dataset for in-depth research, including more variables related to specific cancer types and treatments.\nSupplementary Datasets: Data commonly used with to SEER or NCCR, including U.S. Mortality, U.S. Populations, Standard Populations, County/Tract Attributes, Expected Survival, and SEER Linked Databases. The Linked Databases include SEER-Medicare, SEER-Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (SEER-MHOS), SEER-Medicaid, and SEER-Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (SEER-CAHPS).\nSpecialized Datasets: Specialized Datasets include additional variables not found in the standard SEER Research Data and require access to the latest SEER Research Plus Data. Available databases cover various specific cancers and attributes, such as Pharyngeal Cancer with HPV Status, Prostate Cancer with additional fields, and Incidence Data with Census Tract Attributes, with some requiring NCI Central IRB approval 11.\n\n\nThe types of data collected and represented in these include 7:\n\n\nDemographic Data: Basic demographics like age, gender, race, socioeconomic status, family characteristics, and geographic location information such as state and urbanicity.\nSurvival Outcomes: Information on the patient’s survival status and follow-up data, including the length of survival and cause of death.\nTumor Characteristics: Details about the primary tumor site, morphology, stage at diagnosis, extent and history of the disease, and other relevant attributes.\nInitial Treatments: Data on the first course of treatment administered to patients, including surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.\n\n\nIn addition to its data, SEER has created software tools and webpages designed to simplify data access, analysis, and dissemination. They also interface with SEER data and other cancer-related databases for facilitating data retrieval and analyses 4–6.\n\n\nSEER*Explorer: A webpage that provides SEER cancer summary statistics by race, age, sex, stage, and cancer subtypes, covering 46% of the U.S. population.\nNCCR*Explorer: A webpage that provides childhood, adolescent and young adult cancer summary statistics from National Childhood Cancer Registry (NCCR) data for ages 0-39 using International Classification of Childhood Cancer (ICCC).\nSEER*Stat: A computer software for analyzing SEER data and other cancer-related databases, specializing in endopoints about incidence rates, survival, and prevelance.\nSEERPrep: Converts user-supplied ASCII text data files to SEERStat database format.\nSEER Data Management System (SEER*DMS): Supports all core cancer registry functions including importing data, editing, linkage, consolidation, and reporting."

    "text": "Overview\nOverseen and supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the All of Us (AoU) initiative is a precision medicine program that connects researchers, healthcare providers, technology experts, community partners, and the public. It aims to gather longitudinal data from participants with diverse backgrounds, including age, ethnicity, lifestyle, and geographic location, to create effective individualized treatments for these groups. Participation is available at no cost to anyone living in the U.S. 1–3\nCurrently, around 600,000 participants have agreed to share their electronic health records (EHR), completed the first three surveys, provided physical measurements, and donated at least one biospecimen for biobank storage. This effort has resulted in researchers gaining access to over 473,000 electronic health records and 611,000 biospecimens 4.\nThe types of data collected include 5,6:\n\n\nElectronic Health Records: The data is standardized following Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM) standards and is then compiled into eleven tables. These tables include information on basic demographics, visit details, conditions, device usage, labs, and procedures carried out by healthcare providers 7.\nBiosamples And Bioassays (Genomics): Additional samples of blood, saliva, and/or urine are contributed by some participants for genomic sequencing assays.\nSurveys: Each participant fills out core surveys that include questions about basic demographics, socioeconomic information, tobacco, alcohol, and recreational drug use, as well as overall health and daily activities. Participants can also choose to participate in five additional surveys on behavioral health, healthcare access, and family history 8.\nPhysical Measurements: There are three sources for physical measurements: electronic health records (EHRs), an in-person visit for baseline physical measurements, and self-reported height and weight.\nWearable Devices (Digital Health): Participants can choose to share health tracking data from wearable devices, such as Fitbit, which includes physical activity levels, heart rate, and sleep patterns.\nPartnered Research Studies: Program partners can gather additional data and contribute it to the All of Us dataset, such as the Exploring the Mind study done in partnership with the National Institute of Mental Health."

Refer to Access and DURA Support Questions for common questions about the application process 11.\n\n\n\nThe DURA application timeline varies, as institutions may experience different lengths of time during the application process. For additional questions, please contact aoudurasupport@vumc.org 11.\n\n\n\n\n  ×\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nStep-by-Step Guide\na. Register for a Researcher Workbench Account 12\n\n\nOpen the Researcher Workbench registration webpage and search your institution.\nIf your institution already has a DURA in place for the required tiers of access, you can proceed. Otherwise, select the “My Institution Isn’t Listed” button to start the process of adding your institution.\nClick the “Create An Account” button, which will take you to the Workbench Log In portal. In the bottom-left corner, click “Create Account” again to start the registration process.\nSelect your institution, enter your institution-affiliated email, and choose your role at the institution.\nFill in the required fields and create a username associated with a new Google Account using the “@researchallofus.org” domain, including:\n\n\n\nYour institutional mailing address\nYour research background, experience, and research interests (displayed publicly)\nLink to your your professional profile or bio page below (if available)\n\n\n\nYou will then be asked 15 questions about your identity, such as race, gender, sexual orientation, level of ambulation, etc., which you have the option to complete.\nOnce all fields are completed, submit your request. Activation of your account typically takes 1-2 hours to complete.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nA valid Virtual Private Network (VPN) must be used every time the All of Us Workbench is accessed. For Yale-affiliates, this will be the IST-provided VPN. Despite the protections offered by Yale’s on-campus YaleSecure network, All of Us mandates the use of a VPN when accessing their portal at all times.\n\n\nb. Request Access to Registered Tier-Level Data 9,11\n\n\nConfigure your active Workbench account with Google 2-step verification\nVerify your identity through Login.gov or ID.me. More details about this process can be found on the Identity Verification page. If you encounter any issues, refer to the troubleshooting guide or contact support at support@researchallofus.org 11.\nNavigate to the “Data Access Requirements” page, located in the sidebar under your profile name.\nComplete our Responsible Conduct of Research training. You can find out more about the Responsible Conduct of Research Training process on the Registration and Account Questions page.\nSign the Data User Code of Conduct (DUCC), which can be reviewed here under the “Data Use Policies” section 9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou must annually complete refresher training, re-attest to the Data User Code of Conduct, and update your contact information and institutional affiliation to maintain access.\n\n\nc. Start a New Workspace to Analyze Data 13\nEach time you want to access data, you will do so by creating a project called a “Workspace.” When opening a new Workspace, you will provide the billing account information and answer a series of research statement questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nSome of these answers are made publicly available so the community can assess data use activities and report any concerns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNew account holders will receive $300 in computational credits and can create a Google billing account if additional credits are needed.\n\n\nFor example, you will be asked to provide:\n\n\nDescription of the project’s purpose, including a summary that explains the specific scientific question(s) you intend to study, the scientific approaches you plan to use, and the anticipated findings from the study.\nDescription of the various ways you intend to disseminate your research findings, such as publication in a peer-reviewed journal, conference presentation, personal blog, social media, etc.\nChoose statements regarding how (or if) your research outcomes might align with the All of Us Research Program Scientific Framework.\nDisclose underrepresented populations that will be a focus of your research study, and specifically evaluate the appropriate use of American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) population data.\n\n\nIf you need assistance or would like help assessing whether your study might become stigmatizing, you can request that the Resource Access Board review your study summary prior to conducting the research.\nOnce your Workspace application is submitted, you can access data within the tier of controlled access you have permission to use in the All of Us cloud computing platform. This virtual environment comes with preloaded computational resources and tools, including R/RStudio, Jupyter Notebook with R and Python kernels, Cromwell, SQL, SAS, and a command-line application called “Cloud Analysis Terminal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBe mindful of the compute power and disk space you select, as these incur different charges on an hourly and monthly basis while the Workspace is active.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo I Qualify?\nThe Controlled Tier is an optional extension to the Registered Tier, offering access to genomic data (short-read and long-read WGS, structural variants, genotyping arrays), previously suppressed demographic data from EHRs and surveys, and unshifted event dates. Researchers affiliated with institutions that have signed the All of Us Data Use and Registration Agreement (DURA) can register for free access 9.\nAny research using All of Us data must aim to positively impact public health and wellbeing while adhering to stringent ethical standards. The research must not cause harm, discrimination, mistreatment, or marginalization of any social groups, thus supporting inclusivity and societal benefit.\nCheck the Registered Institutions page to see if your institution is listed and which access level you can attain. If your institution is not listed, you can submit a request form linked on the same page 10.\n\n\nTypical Timeline\nControlled Tier access is an addition to the Registered Tier level and requires a signed agreement and permission from your institution before completing the training, which may vary for applicants. The additional training modules are not expected to take more than a day to complete.\n\n\nStep-by-Step Guide\na. Register for a Researcher Workbench Account and Complete Registered Tier-Level Access Requests 9,11,12\nYou will first need to complete the steps to gain Registered Tier access, listed in the previous tab. If you have not completed these, please go back to those steps before proceeding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nA valid Virtual Private Network (VPN) must be used every time the All of Us Workbench is accessed.
