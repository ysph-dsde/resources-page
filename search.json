    "text": "Overview\nUK Biobank provides an ongoing clinical study biobank offering the most comprehensive dataset of biological, health, and lifestyle information from half a million participants since initial recruitment in 2006 1,5. Participants were recruited from 22 centers in Scotland, England, and Wales, with over 86% living in urban areas. Since recruitment from 2006 to 2010, these participants have consistently provided data on health records, physical measurements, lifestyle and environment, questionnaires, and biospecimens 1,6.\nThe UK Biobank continually enhances its research value by integrating biomedical data with external sources, collecting additional data points, and generating new data from biospecimens. They have introduced new research initiatives, including lifestyle questionnaires, wearable technology, and one of the world’s largest sleep surveys and whole-body imaging projects 2–4.\nParticipants were aged between 40 and 69 years and living in the UK when they joined the study between 2006 and 2010, with half being female. They represent various socioeconomic backgrounds, with more than 40,000 born outside the UK. Participants tend to be wealthier and healthier than the national average, reflecting a common ‘healthy volunteer bias’ 5–7. Despite this, the sufficient number of participants across various risk levels allows the findings to be broadly generalizable to the UK. 94.6% of participants are of white ethnicity, reflecting the national population at the time of recruitment (94.5% in the 2001 UK Census and 91.3% in 2011). Consequently, the data does not effectively represent disease risk across different ethnic groups 6.\nThe types of data collected include 8:\n\n\nDemographic, Lifestyle, and Self-Reported Health Data: Basic demographics and socioeconomic status; family characteristics like illnesses of parents and siblings; lifestyle habits such as physical activity and diet; sociodemographic factors like education and employment; and various medical conditions including eyesight and mental health 9.\nImaging: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans of the brain, heart, and abdomen, full-body bone density scans (DXA/DEXA) scans, carotid ultrasound images, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) scans, and COVID-19 repeat scans 10.\nBiomarker: 251 metabolic biomarkers, 3,000 proteins using OLINK’s proteomic assays, infectious disease antigens, 34 components in blood and urine, and blood counts including examples such as basophils, eosinophils, neutrophils, red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and haemoglobin 11.\nGenetic: Around 850,000 genetic variants directly measured, more than 90 million variants predicted using statistical methods, whole exomes and genomes, and telomere length 12.\nHealth Records: Coded hospital data for diagnoses and procedures, coded general practitioner (GP) data containing codes about diagnoses, prescriptions, and referrals (excluding confidential notes or letters), cancer diagnoses from national cancer registries, deaths data, and algorithmically classified outcomes based on qualifying diagnostic and/or procedural codes for conditions such as asthma, COPD, dementia, myocardial infarction, and stroke 13.\nPhysical Measurements: Collected during the first “baseline” visit: participants’ height, weight, waist and hip circumference, lung capacity, body composition (muscle and fat mass), hand grip strength, heel bone density, blood pressure, arterial stiffness, vision, hearing, touchscreen tests for memory, fitness level and activity monitored for one week, and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) 14.\nQuestionnaire Results: Some participants completed detailed questionnaires covering topics such as diet (e.g., food preferences and a 24-hour food recall), cognitive function, occupational history, mental health, digestive health, pain, and overall health and wellbeing 15.\nEnvironmental Data: Air pollution near participants’ residences, noise pollution, greenspace in participants’ local areas, the nearby built environment and traffic intensity, the distance of their homes to the coast, and tap water minerals 16."

    "section": "Gaining Access",
    "text": "Gaining Access\n\nResearch Plus and NCCR Data\n\n\n\nDo I Qualify?\nUK Biobank data are made available to eligible researchers from academic, charity, government, and commercial organizations worldwide for health-related research that serves the public interest. Any research using UK Biobank data must aim to positively impact public health and wellbeing while adhering to stringent ethical standards. The research must not cause harm, discrimination, mistreatment, or marginalization of any social groups, thus supporting inclusivity and societal benefit.\nTo be eligible to access the data, researchers must demonstrate a proven track record of legitimate health-related research. They must also be affiliated with a recognized research organization and operate from a country that complies with international regulations and is not subject to UK, US, or EU sanctions, as outlined in the UK Biobank International Sanctions Policy. Additionally, the UK Biobank no longer accepts applications from insurance companies, as specified in the Access to UK Biobank Data section under “Controlling Access.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nUK Biobank ensures compliance with these eligibility requirements by conducting thorough background checks on researchers applying for data access. This is done by trained personnel who verify the legitimacy of the applicants and their research credentials.\n\n\n\n\nHow Is My Application Assessed?\nThe application process will involve the Access Committee (AC), a sub-committee of the UK Biobank Board. The AC, which meets on a quarterly basis, is responsible for making key access decisions, notably those regarding the use of depletable samples, recontact, or potentially contentious research. The AC will assess the application for:\n\n\nThe likelihood of the proposed research receiving approval\nThe proposed research’s compliance with the required access criteria (including legal and ethical standards)\nThe availability of the requisite data and/or samples for the proposed research\nThe scientific justification for the amount of depletable sample required\nThe cost associated with providing the requested data and/or samples\n\n\n\n\nTypical Timeline\nRegistration is reviewed within 10 working days\nA couple days to register the Access team to review the MRC certificate.\nCosts are per application, and each application grants 3 years of data access once approved, payment received, and Material Transfer Agreement executed.\nData is usually released weekly, whereas samples are distributed following a predetermined schedule.\n\n\nStep-by-Step Guide\nAll researchers must register, complete training modules, and sign user agreements in the UK Biobank Access Management System (AMS) before they can request data. The AMS allows you to manage your portfolio information and check which outstanding trainings need to be completed to gain access. Once certain criteria have been met, you can request data access through AMS, which you can then access via the DNAnexus UK Biobank cloud computing portal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIt is recommended to use Google Chrome to access the AMS due to identified compatibility issues with certain browsers, such as Firefox and Safari.\n\n\na. Register for Access in the Access Management System (AMS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf your institution is not approved, you will not be able to complete AMS registration until it gains approval to access UK Biobank data.\n\n\n\n\nRegister for an AMS account for free using your institution’s email address.\nVerify your new account.\nTo complete the registration process, log in to the UK Biobank AMS system using your recently verified credentials.\nYou will then see a message window that prompts you to complete your registration by providing additional details about you. The mandatory fields include:\n\n\n\nYour full name, phone number, and date of birth\nAn up-to-date resume/CV in English confirming your current position and institution, OR a link to a personal profile page on your institution’s website\nPubMed reference numbers for up to 5 peer-reviewed publications where you are listed as an author (if available)\nDetails of any complaints raised against you within the past 3 years (if applicable)\nName of the primary institution you are affiliated with that has approved access to UK Biobank data\nYour email address with this institution and used for registration\nYour position at this institution\nList other institutions with which you plan to use the UK Biobank Resource (if applicable)\n\n\n\nThe registration team will review your application and send a message within the AMS portal. They may contact you to request further details.\n\n\nb. Complete the Training Modules and Sign the User Agreements\nThe Home page of your AMS portal will display notices about mandatory training along with any announcements or important information. Outstanding training module requests can be found on the Profile page in the “Training” section. Additionally, you can find previously uploaded Medical Research Council (MRC) certificates there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou must annually complete the MRC course “Research, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) & Confidentiality” and upload the passing certificate. You may also be asked to recomplete the two introductory courses and their accompanying multiple-choice tests.\n\n\n\n\nComplete the MRC course “Research, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) & Confidentiality”, which consists of 10 short video. If this is your first time logging into the MRC Centre for Research Policy Learning Management System, you will need to first create and verify a new account.\nTake the MRC course 10-question multiple-choice quiz. You must pass with a score of 70% or higher for the certificate to be accepted by the Access team.\nSave a PDF copy of the passing completion certificate and upload it in the “Upload MRC Certificate” section of your AMS Profile page.\nComplete the course video “Introduction to using UK Biobank”.\nComplete the course video “Introduction to the UK Biobank Research Analysis Platform (RAP)”.\nTake the two multiple-choice tests, found in the “Training” section of your AMS Profile page. You must pass with a score of 80% or higher to complete the process.\n\n\nThe three courses listed are mandatory to gain access. UK Biobank has also released additional courses as part of this set, such as the “Code Repository” course, which includes its own test.\nc. Apply to Receive Data\nOnce registration is completed, an “Applications” page link will appear in the sidebar. There are two options when requesting access to data: data only or data and biospecimens. Both application types have distinct features but follow similar review processes, which are summarized below. Researchers can find specific details about the application contents in their AMS portals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nSome of these answers are made publicly available so the community can assess data use activities and report any concerns.\n\n\n\n\nComplete one of the applications for either data only or data and biospecimens. For example, some of the fields in the application include:\n\n\n\nA summary of the research you intend to conduct in the project, including the research questions, objectives, and scientific rationale (displayed publicly)\nKeywords describing the research\nConfirmations that the research will be used to perform health-related research and ultimately aims to improve public health\nThe type and size of the data requested\nConfirmation if your research requires biospecimens, and if recontacting participants is needed\nDescription of the methods\nA statement if the study will result in the generation of new data\n\n\n\nList of all project collaborators with their contact details.\nIndicate the tier of data you are requesting, as each tier comes with different associated costs. For more information on the fees, visit the biobank’s Fee Structure page.\nSubmit the form for review by the AC, which meets quarterly. Refer to the previous section titled “How Is My Application Assessed?” for more details about this process.\nApproved applications will require the execution of the Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) and payment of access charges before the release of data and/or samples to the Applicant Principal Investigator (PI). Afterward, the materials will be released.\n\nData is usually released weekly, whereas samples are distributed following a predetermined schedule.\n\n\n\nAccessing the Data\nIn the past, researchers were required to download requested data and agree to delete it upon the completion of their study. With the introduction of the UK Biobank Research Analysis Platform (UKB-RAP), a secure cloud-based analysis environment, researchers now access and analyze the data directly on the platform, with few exceptions.\nAfter completing the training needed, you will then need to register for a UK Biobank data DNAnexus account and link it to your AMS account.\nOur in-house scientists then assess whether the research proposal qualifies as health-related research in the public interest. This means the findings should be likely to benefit the health and wellbeing of society, and should not cause harm, such as perpetuate stereotypes about certain groups.\nIf there is any doubt about this, or if the proposal raises any concerns, it is referred to UK Biobank’s expert Access Committee (AC) which will consider the application in more detail, and seek ethics advice if needed."

    "text": "Overview\nThe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a program designed to assess the health and nutritional status of the U.S. population. Initiated under the National Health Survey Act of 1956, the program initially focused on statistically measuring the extent, distribution, and impact of chronic illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and disabilities through three National Health Examination Surveys (NHES). In the 1970s, the program expanded to include research on diet-disease relationships, where it adopted the name NHANES 3,4.\nNHANES has significantly impacted public health by supplying essential data for developing public health strategies and policies, particularly through its detailed dietary research, which has informed national nutritional guidelines and initiatives to combat chronic diseases 2. NHANES is representative of the U.S. population, utilizing complex, multistage, highly-stratified clusters to randomly select participants, ensuring generalizability to the U.S. population as a whole. The survey design often includes oversampling of underrepresented groups, such as ethnic minorities and vulnerable populations, to enhance research accuracy 4–6.\nThere have been three NHES cycles, five NHANES installments, and four ancillary studies, each using different sampling methods and sometimes focusing on specific populations or health outcomes 7–11. The number of participants enrolled varies between each iteration, typically ranging from 5,000 to 10,000 participants per year 5,6,12–19.\nThe types of data collected include:\n\n\nDemographic Data: Basic demographics like age, gender, race, socioeconomic status, family characteristics, and geographic location information such as state and urbanicity.\nHealth and Medical Examinations: Medical history and records, physical and dental examinations, vision and hearing tests, X-rays, and anthropometric measurements such as height, weight, and body mass index.\nLaboratory Work: Blood, urine, and other biological specimens are collected to test for nutritional biomarkers, environmental exposures, and indicators of infectious and chronic diseases.\nPsychosocial and Behavioral Data: Psychological evaluations including measures of mental health and distress, behavioral assessments covering smoking, alcohol, and drug use, and physical activity and fitness measures.\nQuestionnaire Results: Participants provide self-reported information on a variety of health-related topics, including medical history, health conditions, and behaviors like smoking and physical activity.\nDietary Data: Nutritional status assessments, including dietary intake, nutrient composition, dietary frequency, and 24-hour food consumption recall.\nSpecial Focus Variables: Detailed examinations for chronic conditions including, but not limited to, child growth and development metrics, epidemiologic follow-ups, and specific tests and variables based on subpopulation-focused surveys such as the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES) 7–10,20.\n\n\nBecause NHANES collects data from different individuals in two-year cycles, it is a cross-sectional survey rather than a longitudinal one. The complex sampling design ensures nationally representative results when analyzed with the provided sample weights for each installment.\nResearchers interested in combining cross-sectional iterations for longitudinal research should carefully review the recommendations provided in the NHANES Questionnaires, Datasets, and Related Documentation on the CDC landing page for each program 11. Additional support can be found in:\n\n\nHistorical NHANES Component Matrix 16\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey: 1999–2022 Survey Content Brochure 21\nNHANES Survey Methods and Analytic Guidelines, which consolidates some of the program’s documentation 22\n2017–March 2020 Prepandemic File: Sample Design, Estimation, and Analytic Guidelines for additional details 23"

Simply navigate to the page with the NHANES program installment you want to use and download it. Be aware that specific considerations are needed to combine two different installments or biannual Continuous NHANES datasets. Refer to the relevant data documentation or any of the webinars and tutorials available for further directions on how to best handle survey design and protocol differences.\n\n\n\n\nDo I Qualify?\nAll individuals seeking to use the data for statistical analysis and reporting purposes are allowed to submit a research proposal to the NCHS Research Data Center (RDC) through the Standard Application Process (SAP) available through the ResearchDataGov (RDG) portal 24,25.\nApplicants must fulfill the following criteria during the application review process, and in some cases, after application approval. These criteria are summarized from the RDG User Guide. If additional steps are required post-approval, the data-owning agency will contact you directly to initiate those processes.\nIdentification: Verify your identity, job title, organizational affiliation, and skill level. Some agencies require confirmation of U.S. citizenship.\nTraining: Some agencies require training on data use, data management, confidentiality, and cybersecurity following application approval.\nAgreements: Sign agreements such as non-disclosure agreements or data use agreements. Some data sources may require the creation of a security plan outlining how the researcher will protect the data.\nInvestigation: Undergo a background check.\n\n\nHow Is My Application Assessed?\nAll applications submitted through SAP are evaluated against the same criteria, regardless of the agency or unit you are applying to for data, unless required by law or regulation. The full criteria are linked in the RDG User Guide, and summarized below 26:\nStatistical Purpose: Data will be used solely for statistical purposes and not to identify individual persons or businesses, nor for law enforcement, legal cases, or regulatory actions.\nAllowed Use: The researcher plans to use the data in compliance with the applicable rules and restrictions.\nStatistical Disclosure Limitation: The researcher must be able to use techniques that protect the privacy of individuals, organizations, or businesses.\nDemonstrated Need: The researcher must show that confidential data is necessary to support their project goals and that publicly available data is insufficient.\nFeasibility: The researcher is able to achieve their project goals with the requested data. This is evaluated in three ways:\n\n\nProject Design: Detailed methods planned and how the technical and logistical needs will be met.\nAgency or Unit Support: Confirming beforehand that the agency can support the project through space, technical help, logistics, and preparation of the data.\nApplicant Ability: The applicant has the knowledge, skills, and ability to carry out the project.\n\n\nMaintaining Public Trust: The project is expected to help maintain the public’s trust and confidence in the agency or unit.\nIn addition to these criteria, the NCHS Review Committee will assess whether the study has a well-defined research question that addresses a public health concern, whether the results will benefit the agencies providing the data, and the appropriateness of the planned output from the study (e.g., paper, journal article, or presentation) 27.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe NCHS will not evaluate your study to assess its scientific merit nor its substantive, methodological, theoretical, or policy relevance. It also does not provide guarantees that output generated by the study will be released contingent on concerns related, but not limited to, privacy and is in alignment with the approved application.\n\n\n\n\nTypical Timeline\n\n  \n  \n    A summary of the application process, including information on when additional reviews may be necessary.\n  \n\n\n\n\n  ×\n  \n  \n\n\n\nUpon receiving an application, your assigned RDC analyst and the review committee—comprising data system representatives and the confidentiality officer—will assess your application for approval, disapproval, or a request for revisions. If your application is denied by the committee, you will be provided with a justification for the decision. Researchers are allowed to request an appeal of the decision through SAP 28.\nAt some point, your study may require an amendment to the approved application. Approval for amendments typically take no more than four weeks, but can take as many as eight to twelve weeks if the amendment request is complicated.\n\n\nStep-by-Step Guide\na. Prepare Your Application Before Completing the Form\nThe RDG portal provides access to applications for data from 13 agencies and 3 units within the Federal Statistical System (FSS), including the NCHS. Each agency may have additional expectations for the application process that you will need to include if you are requesting data from them. While many details are available in the RDG User Guide or the RDC Application Process page (some of which are summarized here), researchers are advised to contact the agencies or units from which they are requesting data before submitting their application.\nExample applications, data dictionaries, and complete details can be found on the RDC Application Process page 24. The summary provided here is intended solely to offer an outline and introduce you to the location of relevant information. You can reach the RDC directly at rdca@cdc.gov for further information 26.\n\n\nConfirm that your study requires access to restricted data and that the data available through the FSS will meet your research needs. Contact all agencies or units responsible for the data to confirm that the data you need can be combined with all of the data required for your analysis, whether restricted-use, publicly available, or non-FSS.\nNOTE: Data access methods and locations may vary, especially if the data comes from different agencies or units within the FSS.\nDecide on your preferred location of access, and confirm that you are eligible to gain access at that location. If you are not a U.S. citizen, it is recommended that you reach out to the facility where you intend to access the data prior to writing your proposal. Refer to the Data Distribution Centers section below for further details.\nThe NCHS requires additional documents as *.pdf or *.docx and additional concerns to be addressed beyond the base SAP application. Before starting your application, it is recommended that you prepare the following:\n\n\n\nA data dictionary listing all the requested variables from publicly available, restricted-use, and non-NCHS data sources. Much of this can be created in SAP. Refer to the Providing the Public Use and Non-NCHS Data page for additional guidelines on preparing your application with these types of data.\nDescription of the research methodology.\nList of supporting references.\nDetailed description of the intended data product (e.g., paper, journal article, or presentation).\nTimeline for managing the project within a three-year period.\nIn the Agency Benefits section, you must demonstrate how your project will benefit NCHS or other agencies providing the data.\nDetermine and decide on your preferred access location.\n\n\n\nb. Complete the SAP Application Form\n\n\nIn SAP, search for and select the datasets you need for your study, then add them to your basket. Any data added to the same basket will be included in a single application.\nNOTE: You can add additional data to the application if needed after submission.\nWhen you are ready to proceed with the application, open your basket and select Start Application. It is recommended that the principal investigator (PI) or co-principal investigator (co-PI) create the application, as only they will be able to make edits after submission.\nIn the application, you will need to provide researcher information, a description of the project that demonstrates the need for restricted-use data, and upload the required documents as *.pdf or *.docx. The standard SAP application and some agency- or unit-specific requirements can be found in the RDG User Guide.\nSubmit the application for review.\n\n\nc. Review the Committee’s Decision and Finalize the Application\nUpon receiving the application, the RDC director will assign your group an RDC analyst who will work with you throughout the entire process of applying for data, accessing the data, and finalizing the output of your results 27. The RDC analyst will:\n\n\nFacilitate the review of your application and accept your NCHS-required confidentiality paperwork.\nAccept payments incurred by accessing the data at a data center.\nCreate your analytical dataset by compiling the data requested in the data dictionary and combining it based on the variables you assign for linking. This dataset will be provided to you when you visit a data center.\nAfter you complete your analysis at a data center, they will review your output for disclosure risk and provide you with the results.\n\n\nApproved applications must then complete the following steps in preparation to access and utilize the approved data.\n\n\nDiscuss the committee’s approval with your assigned RDC analyst and address any requests for revision as needed.\nProvide the RDC analyst with the approved data dictionary, public-use and non-NCHS data, descriptions of desired data linkages with their intended final format, and clearly defined derived variables, including any arithmetic code or algorithms.\nComplete the Confidentiality and Disclosure training and forms, and provide them to the RDC analyst. Additional forms, documents, and tools for this step can also be found on the RDC Reference Materials page 29,30.\nWhen invoiced, you will need to pay the fees incurred by your request and applicable to accessing the data at your intended location and frequency of access. Refer to Fees and Invoicing for complete details 31.\n\n\nd. Accessing the Data and Publication Expectations\n\n\nAfter completing the steps in Part C, the RDC analyst will prepare your dataset. Once it is ready, set up an appointment to access the data at your chosen RDC location. Please schedule your appointment at least one week in advance.\nNOTE: Different data centers have different procedures for gaining access and might incur additional fees depending on how frequently you intend to access the data. Refer to the Data Distribution Centers section and associated links for additional guidance.\nUpon completion of your analysis, you must submit an output request to your RDC analyst for review and approval. Find the full details about the requirements and expectations on the Output Policies and Procedures page 32.\nNOTE: The NCHS does not provide guarantees that output generated by the study will be released contingent on concerns related, but not limited to, privacy and is in alignment with the approved application.\nWhen you have nearly completed your output, send it to your RDC analyst for review before submitting it for publication or distribution. Find the full details about requirements and expectations on the Publishing Guidelines page 33.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAmendments for project changes are possible but require additional approval prior to implementation. Common reasons for an amendment include, but are not limited to, changes in the research team, requests for additional variables, new methods, or requests for additional types of output 24. However, if you wish to change the scope or research question, a new application is required instead.\nContact the RDC directly at rdca@cdc.gov for further guidance.\n\n\n\n\nData Distribution Centers\nNCHS data is available at two types of data centers: the Census Bureau’s Federal Statistical Research Data Centers (FSRDC) and the NCHS Research Data Centers (RDCs). Additional details about preparing to access your data at one of these sites can be found on the RDC Location of Access page or their respective subpages: FSRDC and NCHS RDC 24,34–36.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nYou must submit an electronic copy of any notes or reference materials you need to your RDC analyst prior to visiting a center. Hard copies of these materials are not allowed. You are also not allowed to bring electronic communication devices, such as phones, pagers, laptops, into the RDC.\n\n\nYou can request different software products or add-ons, though not all requests will be approved. Be aware that requesting additional software accommodations may delay the approval of your project. Contact the specific RDC where you plan to access your data for further guidance.\n\nFederal Statistical Research Data Centers\n\n\nYou will be assigned both an NCHS RDC analyst and an FSRDC administrator from the location you intend to visit. Both have different roles.\nResearchers must meet physical and information security requirements. They must obtain Census Bureau Special Sworn Status (SSS) and pass a background investigation.\nYou must be affiliated with a university or agency to qualify.\nNon-U.S. citizens are generally encouraged to use FSRDCs.\nIn-person: Census Bureau facilities at partner institutions.\nRemote access: A secure Virtual Desktop Interface (VDI) may be available.\nSoftware Available: Anaconda, Gurobi, Intel Composer, Knittro, MADD, Mathematica, NATLAB, OpenGeoda, R and Rstudio, SAS, Stat/Transfer, Stata, Stata-MP, SUDAAN, and Tomlab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIf you are accessing an FSRDC, the data must be transferred from NCHS after completing all requirements outlined by your assigned RDC analyst seven days prior to your intended visit. These additional steps incur extra costs beyond the NCHS RDC data access fee and may delay data access.\n\n\nPreviously, the roles of RDC analysts were listed. The FSRDC, or Census RDC, administrator will:\n\n\nBe available to answer questions pertaining to SSS, access and entry to a FSRDC location, software availability, and additional, Census fees.\nThey may be available to help develop your application.\nTransfer your output to the NCHS after you complete your analysis at a data center. Your RDC analyst will review your output for disclosure risk and provide you with the results.\n\n\n\n\nNCHS Research Data Centers\n\n\nIn-person: Facilities are located in Hyattsville, MD, Atlanta, GA, and Rockville, MD and are accessible by appointment only at least one week in advance.\nRemote access: The computers are not connected to the internet, so remote access is not possible.\nSoftware Available: Microsoft Office products, R, SAS, Stata, Python, SPSS (v. 19), and SAS-callable SUDAAN.\n\n\n\n\nRequired Documentation\nWhen accessing the data, the researcher will need to provide the following documentation in addition to an approved application:\n\n\nProof of identification, such as a REAL ID.\nCurriculum vitae (CV) for each applicant.\nFor student projects, the student’s advisor must provide an agreement form.\nPermission to use proprietary data.\nRequested output must include Table Shells.\nRequested variables must be provided in a data dictionary format that lists all necessary variables (i.e., restricted-use, public-use, and external) for the research project. Please refer to the agency dataset data dictionaries for the available variables."

    "text": "Overview\nThe Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) is supported by the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) Surveillance Research Program (SRP), which provides national leadership in cancer surveillance science and offers the tools and expertise necessary for collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and disseminating reliable population-based statistics. Since 1973, SEER has provided vital cancer statistics, growing to cover 45.9% of the US population across 22 geographic areas with its data on cancer incidence and survival. To date, they have recorded as many as approximately 17 million cases in some of their registries, almost 16 million of which represent malignant cases 1,2.\nSEER data includes patient demographics, tumor characteristics, initial treatments, and survival outcomes, offering significant representation of various racial and ethnic groups across the nation 2,7. The data is collected from participating cancer registries, which can be either population-based or hospital-based, with special registries focusing on specific cancers 8.\nThe types of data products available include 3,7,9,10:\n\n\nSEER Research Data: The standard SEER data, which provides information on cancer incidence and survival from population-based cancer registries. The data encompasses patient demographics, primary tumor site, tumor morphology, stage at diagnosis, extent and history of the disease, initial treatments, and survival outcomes.\nSEER Research Plus and NCCR Data: This expanded category includes all the SEER Research Data as well as additional variables and detailed information not included in the standard dataset, such as geography, month in addition to year of diagnosis, and other demographic fields.

    "text": "Overview\nOverseen and supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the All of Us (AoU) initiative is a precision medicine program that connects researchers, healthcare providers, technology experts, community partners, and the public. It aims to gather longitudinal data from participants with diverse backgrounds, including age, ethnicity, lifestyle, and geographic location, to create effective individualized treatments for these groups. Participation is available at no cost to anyone living in the U.S. 1–3\nCurrently, around 600,000 participants have agreed to share their electronic health records (EHR), completed the first three surveys, provided physical measurements, and donated at least one biospecimen for biobank storage. This effort has resulted in researchers gaining access to over 473,000 electronic health records and 611,000 biospecimens 4.\nThe types of data collected include 5,6:\n\n\nElectronic Health Records: The data is standardized following Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM) standards and is then compiled into eleven tables. These tables include information on basic demographics, visit details, conditions, device usage, labs, and procedures carried out by healthcare providers 7.\nBiosamples And Bioassays (Genomics): Additional samples of blood, saliva, and/or urine are contributed by some participants for genomic sequencing assays.\nSurveys: Each participant fills out core surveys that include questions about basic demographics, socioeconomic information, tobacco, alcohol, and recreational drug use, as well as overall health and daily activities. Participants can also choose to participate in five additional surveys on behavioral health, healthcare access, and family history 8.\nPhysical Measurements: There are three sources for physical measurements: electronic health records (EHRs), an in-person visit for baseline physical measurements, and self-reported height and weight.\nWearable Devices (Digital Health): Participants can choose to share health tracking data from wearable devices, such as Fitbit, which includes physical activity levels, heart rate, and sleep patterns.\nPartnered Research Studies: Program partners can gather additional data and contribute it to the All of Us dataset, such as the Exploring the Mind study done in partnership with the National Institute of Mental Health."
